When it came in the mail, I looked beautiful with the packaging and had vivid colors. However, the product wasn’t pigmented nor shiny at all when I applied it, as I would have expected. Yes, it is pink, but not that much and the color was sheer. It looked natural, but I needed to put a lot on even if I just wanted that kind of effect. One good thing, though: you don’t need a full size product, if you have multiple blushes like me! It lasts a very long time, as it is a pressed blush. However, I won’t repurchase again because I was disappointed, even if I decided to give their pressed blushes a second chance after the Dandelion came out looking dull on me.

However if you are scent-sensitive, be aware that the perfume is *extremely* strong in the box. It doesn't translate too much to your face as with some powders, but it can be overpowering when applying. Grapefruit and vanilla is not an accurate description--more like jasmine or honeysuckle. Without the scent, the blush would be perfect.

I first bought the mini of this shade (Galifornia) because I figured I didn’t need another full-sized blush that I’ll never finish. I love it- each such a pretty pink with a golden sheen to it. However- I heard a rumor that the mini size version is different in color to the full sized, so I picked the full size Uo during the last sale and... turns out that it is! The full size does have a gold overspray that comes off after a use or two- but it in general has a more golden color to it than the mini. It’s still pink and bright- just I bit more “oomf”. I really like this shade! It’s sooo pretty for a summery, healthy flush to the cheeks!

I wasn’t getting much pigment the first couple of months I was using it, which made it a good blush for work where I don’t want to have obvious makeup on. I tried it on recently after giving it a break and holy moly at the pigment it was giving me. I don’t know if I had gotten past some hard-pan or what, but it turned into a very sexy “I was just outside” flush. Swatch yours every now and then to test the pigment so you’re getting an accurate pigment, or try a few different blush brushes with it. My current brush has very dense bristles so that could be another factor (although it’s the same one I always use). The color is probably one of my favorites ever along with Rockateur. It’s the perfect spring/summer pop of coral-pink that can amp up a natural look in minutes. Also, I want to bathe in whatever they’ve scented this in lol. It smells like all the good parts of sunscreen to me.

I gave it 3 stars not for the product itself but lack thereof of actual product. I ordered online and I'm pretty familiar with Benefits ""box"" packaging for their blushes and bronzers but this was just too small for the price! I wouldn't bother with the pretty sun design either because it's pretty much gone on first swipe. It's fun packaging and pretty color are great but there are other products out there worth a better value.

I stumbled upon the GALifornia blush and read some of the reviews and decided to give it a shot.... and WHOA LET ME TELL YOU! I am in love honestly. I was hesitant at first to even try it because my skin tone is a deeper olive complexion and most of the reviews I read were from users with fair skin. I am so satisfied with this color though, the pigment shows up perfectly on my darker skin tone and last 8-10 hours. Aside from the trendy packaging this blush also has the most pleasant fragrance, which made it the icing on the cake for me! I would most definitely recommend this product!

Either incorporate the gold or don't spray at all! - the scent is strong. Why does a blush have to be scented? I'm not sensitive to fragrances by could see others having issues for this. - the powder is a bit difficult to pick up. No matter what brush I use, I need to press pretty hard to pick up product. - the packaging is silly and not very travel-friendly. Otherwise, it is a pretty colour and lasts on my skin once I manage to pick it up with a brush. I wish I could depot this easily and put in a palette!

The blushes are 2 different colors, go into your local store and swatch them side by side. The full size Galifornia is a pinky coral with a sheen whereas the mini is a matte orange blush. Not sure why no one mentions this but people may be purchasing the mini to save money thinking they're the same. I'm not saying the mini is a bad blush but it's not anything like the full size which is the better purchase, in my opinion.

I actually purchased the travel size, which doesn't have the gold sun, and ended up purchasing the bigger size because I loved the color so much. It's the perfect bright peachy pink. I have light-medium skin, and it looks really natural. It looks great when I do and don't have foundation on.

I wear my makeup for at least 8 hours a day and my blush is definitely still there by the end of the day. It is a gorgeous color. The gold shimmer comes off after one brush swipe but I personally don't care for a shimmery blush seeing as shimmer only enhances texture. This blush smells amazing. It is perfect for light, no makeup days and for intense makeup days. I am pretty tan and think it looks best on similar skin tone.

It's my first benefit blush, and I find it doesn't last any longer than drugstore. I was expecting long lasting like tarte, as my hoola bronzer is my favourite for that. The colour is really nice, but something you could find in any other brand. I saw some people say it's too dark for their fair skin, well I'm as white as they come and with a very light hand it looks great. One let down was the colour was much nicer the first use with the gold overlay mixed in. I knew buying it that it was just an overlay, but it would have been nice to have the gold incorporated in the whole blush. I think the mini is definitely worth it, unfortunately I bought this before the mini was available.
