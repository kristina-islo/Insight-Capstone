But where is the single pan larger size. I can't find it anywhere?! Its heartbreaking. Please Nars return this powder in full size to your permanent collection; your new highlighter just do not compare.

Hot Sand in particular is a beautiful, white/silver-toned highlighter for fair/medium skintones. Although it may not seem like that pigmented when swatched, it's lovely on the face. However, as the Orgasm blush has such a strong gold shimmer it's very odd to pair it with a cool-toned highlighter - Hot Sand is not as champagne/gold on me as it is in the picture. Would have been better to pair it with Deep Throat or another blush shade!
