Blush also tends to disappear within a few hours on me, since I don't use a primer. I'd heard so many people rave about this product and I'm a fan of Hourglass but had only purchased one other product from them prior to this. This blush is amazing. I'm very fair and was afraid it would be too dark but it's stunning. Glowy but natural and also bold. Stays on my skin all day. 10/10 would recommend to anyone who's considering purchasing.

I have about the second palest shade there is. Some brands don't make foundation for my skin color. That said, in any given blush line I can wear 1 maybe 2 of the colors the rest are too dark or too orange. In this line I can wear all but 2 of them. I'm amazed. This color in particular was breathtakingly pretty on and is my new favorite blush. It's also impossible to go too dark with so it makes getting made up in a hurry that much easier. If you have pale, cool toned skin you so need to try this color and if you don't I say try it anyway you may be as surprised by this line as I was.

The blush has a beautiful creamy lilac color. They are perfectly refreshing and do not emphasize the structure, stable and not dusty. They are perfect for every day. Now about the minuses - blush consists of marble layers of color and highlighter and in each jar this ratio is different. I got a 3/4 can of highlighter and 1/4 blush. 1/4 blush ended very quickly with daily use. Now I have 3/4 highlighters stored idle. Bottom line: I put 4 stars for the product, 1 star for the design of the box and take 3 stars for cheating the buyer. I bought a blush, not a highlighter in a bank. And minus 1 star for a terrible customer service from the brand. If you are willing to overpay for a highlighter, then this is a good product. If you need exactly blush or bronzer, then it is better to find another brand. This is roulette.

I saw an influencer use it in one of their videos and it looked so beautiful on her I had to purchase it. When I tried it on there was literally nothing on my face or at least it looked that way. For the price and the way it looked in the video I was expecting much more pigment. I tried to build it up by adding more and more blush on my cheeks but all it did was add glitter. This is the sheerest blush I’ve ever tried. I tried building it up even using different brushes but no pigment at all. I have blushes for more than half the price which show up better on my face. It basically just looks like shiny glitter on my face. I was expecting it to have a warm nude color with some glowy shine but it didn’t have this effect at all. For $40 I expected much better and I’m truly disappointed.

This is not worth $40. It was actually $38 a year ago and a few years back $35 so they obvious been upping the price like crazy. This shade is not that special. It doesn’t transform anything or imparts any special effects. It’s a light pink blush. Nothing special. The packaging is cheap feeling, it’s made of plastic and super light, not luxurious at all, I think the company behind this is just trying to promote this for what it’s not. Anyone who’s trying to tell you this is special or super great is just dumb. It’s not. This brand has only been around since 2004. And it’s formulas are hit and miss, I can’t wait for some other brand to dupe every single thing for a fraction of the price for us consumers.

I first bought 4 of them in march and now for the VIB sale picked up 2 other shades. I own 3 of each finishes. I really like those. The reason it took me so long to purchase them was the fact that I was never wowed when swatching in stores. After reading so many great reviews, I decided to try them out. I'm glad to say that they look really nice on the cheeks. They are really soft and easy to pick up so work nice with a softer/delicate brush on fair skin (I love them with blue squirrel brushes). The colors are very versatile. I like all of the one I own. I must say I didn't purchase the 2 lighter shades even if I have fair skin because they seemed too light for my taste. My favorite shade is mood exposure. Some nude blushes can end up looking dirty on my fair skin but this one looks perfect and does not get confused for a bronzer. It is simply perfection. I also love both finishes and have no problem with staying power. These are my top 2 favorite blushes along with Marc Jacobs airblushes.

It adds a very natural, soft pink flush to the skin. for reference i wear MAC NC10 and im always the lightest shade in every foundation. One thing i will add, is the brush you use definetely makes a difference so dont use one thats too fluffy or you'll have to build it quite a bit!

This color is actually pretty darn bright on me, yet still very natural. My husband doesn't love it when I wear makeup because I look ""too different"" and he has said he really likes this specific blush because while he can see it, it's more natural and I still look like me. I love that it's infused with my preferred finishing/setting powder (Ethereal Light). I sometimes put this over it, other times it goes under, it just depends on how intense I want to wear this. How I apply it doesn't seem to affect wear time, and it easily lasts all day. Quick tip about swatching this. I initially did what we all do, which is rub my finger on the top and then wipe what I picked up on my hand. Don't do that. I think it's cause of the swirl, but you don't get a true representation of the color that way. Ask for help, get a brush, swirl it in the pan and then apply it to see if you like it. It honestly makes a massive difference.

This collection of blushes are the only blush products that I have used right down to the pan. The effect is truly a lite from with in glow that accentuates your complexion with just the right combination of color and highlight. The only down side, and it's minor; because the color is mixed with an ambient highlight shade, applying a separate highlighter to the cheek bone area on top of the Ambient blush can emphasize textural issues, fine lines and wrinkles. I personally stopped using a separate highlighter as I definitely get enough glow from the blush combo alone. There is a good color selection to choose from that will compliment most skin tones and a selection of color's are available in a mini size. The container is large and well worth the $52.00 CAD that I pay. I primarily use Incandescent Electra as it works for all seasons and people always compliment me or tell me my skin is glowing. Try this product, it's going to change your blush game, guaranteed.

Before I wasn't someone who wore blush at all. I have a neutral undertones, but with some surface redness. Putting more pink on my cheeks just seemed counterproductive. Over there years I've tried blushes from Nars, Tarte, Benefit, and so on, and they were nice, but never for me. I also skipped this blush despite all the hype because the Ambient Lighting Powders did next to nothing for me on their own, but in their blush and bronzer formulas it becomes something special. I'm someone who hates glitter or obvious shimmer in products, but I never want to look matte either. I apply this to a slightly tacky face and it just gives you the most natural flush of color with a slight sheen. I don't even need highlighter anymore. Dim Infusion is the perfect color for people who are warm, olive, or neutral. On me it's more of a pinky peach as well. It's also really hard to go overboard with this blush, so it's great to pop on when you're in a rush.

It was stunningly NATURAL looking which is actually what I was going for. Truth is, I don’t “need” Anything new, and have way more makeup than i know what to do with, but want the portability of the stick and pressed and the blush looked so great on top that I couldn’t say no! However, now comes the confusing part...we could not figure out which one he’d use. Because, based on the pan even the “same colors looks different (ie, one had more of the darker mauve tones and another the lighter golden tones, so they swatches completely different). My suggestion is to try on in store if possible and look for one with more swirls of what you’re after. For me, I wanted to see more of the plum color shining through than the gold(ish) one. It stayed all day on top of the MUFE foundation with no touch ups! Very natural and pretty finish. More depth than my normal one shade go to’s (Chanel, Nars)...not all that unsimilar to the Charlotte tilbury blushes that had the pop/highlight color in the middle...this is just dispersed throughout. Buy this, but play with it first!

I own mostly very pigmented, strong, bold blushes. I bought this blush to be my everyday, low key, no fuss blush that goes with everything. It does all of that and more. the only blush that doesn't accentuate my pores and to go on so smoothly and looks extremely natural. on me, the color looks like someone surprised me with a gift and I'm blushing from happiness and excitement. it's Pink-mauve-bronze all mixed together. my husband, who hardly says anything about my makeup unless it's either very good or horribly wrong says, ""your face and cheeks look glowy and beautiful"". Odd. I've gotten other compliments from people so I guess it's not that odd. I have medium-deep tan skin with an olive undertone. highly recommend this one!
