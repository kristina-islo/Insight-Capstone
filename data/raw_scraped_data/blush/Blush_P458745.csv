It was so much fun to stamp and build on the blush. The lipstick wasn’t so much the type of color I like but it was still adorable and I liked the formula. It really did feel like nothing was on my lips, honestly. Super creamy too.",1,0,Recommends this product
blush,KAJA,Kaja Air Heart Lipstick + Cheeky Stamp Blush Set,JohannaMonique,Rouge,Rookie,"['Eye Color Brown', 'Hair color Black', 'Skin Tone Tan', 'Skin Type Combination']",4 stars,4 d ago,yes,,,"Fresh, Fun, Cheeky Vibe!","This value set is so cool, it's definitely a lovely introduction to the Kaja brand if you haven’t tried any of their products before. The price point is amazing for these two full sized products that you receive. The blush gives you a nice, fresh flush of color on the cheeks, I really like the concept it’s fun, however the shade of this blush may not come through as pronounced on deeper complexions past NC42 in M.A.C. The Air Heart Lipstick is amazing, it feels like light whipped creme or frosting on the lips, it does indeed give you that light airy feeling, it's super pigmented and smells really pleasant. This shade is so beautiful it has become one of my favorites. If you’re looking for a subtle, fresh and not overdone look, this set would be perfect for you. Feel free to check out these beauties in action @Johanna Monique (YouTube).
