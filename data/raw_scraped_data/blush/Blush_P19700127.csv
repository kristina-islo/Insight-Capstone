It just brings so much more brightness to my face and livens me right up. The formula is creamy and sheer, not greasy but luminous, and stays put for hours. Love.

I tried it over a couple different foundations. Also, this looked kinda funny on bare skin.

I know a lot of people have complained about the size, but really, a little bit goes a long way. I have tried applying it with my fingers, a sponge and a brush. I would definitely say that brush application is the best. I didn't purchase the brush from fenty because I already had something similar in my collection. as long as it's a dense angled brush, it will work just fine.

I had tried a drugstore cream blush years ago and never bought another cream blush again, but after trying the Fenty blush I am now a HUGE fan. I was steered away with fears of my base/foundation products being removed like the one I had previously tried but this doesn’t do that at all. The color petal poppin is good, but can be a borderline subtle on my medium-tan skin tone from Fenty 255-300. Built up it pops more for a more everyday shade but I would like to try the more intense shades. I was also nervous how it would hold up on my oily skin but this didn’t make me anymore oily at all. It’s super lightweight, Gives a glow but doesn’t transfer, and sets after a min. Blends extremely easily and I can see this lasting a while even though it’s small and for the price is actually not too bad considering I’ve been able to pick them up on sale. I don’t regret purchasing this all and can definitely see myself purchasing more shades.

I think that the price reflects that though, and I don't need very much product per application so the size is not an issue for me at all. I have two shades: Rose Latte and Petal Poppin. I love both shades and often use them together. Rose Latte is a beautiful, bronzy rose, and Petal Poppin is a warm pink. I often lay down Rose Latte and then apply Petal Poppin on the apples of my cheeks. Even layered on top of each other, and usually layered over the Fenty cream bronzer, I don't find that I have any issue with my foundation being moved around or buffed away underneath. I find that these blushes are very pigmented on my fair-light skin so I use a whispy synthetic brush for application and slowly build up the colour.

This cream blush is pigmented (I use a stippling brush with tapping motions on my cheeks) and is very buildable. I am obsessed with this colour!!! Very bright and youthful. I find that layering a thin layer of a similar blush colour to set and build on the colour works best. I find this works best with a long day wear and it truly lasted over 8 hours with minimal fade of colour :)

I think next I’ll buy the dark purple shade for something new and it lasts a long time but I think for most people, this pink shade is a staple already in their collections. I would recommend going for the orange or purple for it to be worth the money.

I really felt motivated to write this review because I feel as though its not being given the glory it deserves. I order this shade right when the product dropped and it took forever to get to me. In the mean time i was watching reviews and reading them on here and I started to get scared, because the reviews were not good. I've been told that I would shade 400 in fenty (I do not wear foundation) and the reviews were saying its too sheer to show up on deep skin tones! Well I am here to say this is not true. If you are looking for a nice golden glow you gotta get this shade, its the perfect highlighter for us brown girls. I was disappointed in how small it is but its okay cause a little goes a long way. I am a concealer, good highlight kinda gal. So for me this is exactly what I was going for as far as a highlight.

I’ve been using it by dipping a big fluffy brush in, and I don’t usually need to go back in once I spread it over my cheeks. The formula is great and this color is GORGEOUS! I went a little bit deeper than I usually would (my regular powder blush is similar to petal poppin) and it’s a gorgeous natural looking flush, almost like I spent a couple of hours in the sun:) I love it so much!

After a few hours, it looks like a bunch of glitter. I'm not sure what I was expecting with this shade, but it was not that. I have oily, acne-prone skin, and I do not think the blushes reacted negatively to my skin, so I will definitely buy more shades. I also have Rosė Latte and I think that shade looks great on me, so the product itself is worth a try. It is a good introductory to cream blushes, but proceed with caution with Fuego Flush.

It was a little bit of a struggle to get the mix of blend and color payoff that I wanted with this as it sheered out pretty quickly too. Would buy another if it was a color I couldn't find elsewhere, but otherwise, I doubt I'd try another one. I do LOVE the Fenty cream bronzer, so not sure why this didn't work as well for me.

They lay on the skin perfectly and give you that slightly translucent blush glow on your cheeks. You can tell this formula won’t slide around on your face during the day, it stays out. I unfortunately chose two colors that didn’t give me what I wanted. I picked petal poppin thinking it’s be a brightish coral baby pink and rose latte expecting a deeper bronze rose color. These two shades literally looked exactly the same on my cheeks! Like how that’s possible I’ll never know lol so I did return them and I’m thinking of trying the fuego flush and bikini one when stores reopen.

I powder/set only under my eyes and nose and around my mouth, after applying all the cream bases. This one (I love NDs cream blushes) is on par with my favourites, for blend-ability and intensity. Using a small brush or the fat end of a sponge, I pounce it lightly on my cheeks until I get the depth I want. Don't dip your brush or sponge too deeply, start slow and build. I've also heard, that since blush is one of the first items to fade, if you layer powder blush over cream, it lasts longer; once the powder fades, the cream is still visible. This colour is a perfect in between pink and peach shade, very natural, delicate and sping-like.

I will say it is more pigmented when I apply with my fingers instead of with a brush, the brush seemed to fade it out a lot no matter how much I applied. One bad thing I noted it that when I set my face with lose powder the color changed to orange real quick. So make sure not to pack powder on top, let it be.
