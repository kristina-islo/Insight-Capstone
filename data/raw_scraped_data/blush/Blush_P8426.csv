blush,STILA,stila Convertible Color,curluck,Rouge,Rookie,"['Eye Color Blue', 'Hair color Brunette', 'Skin Tone Light', 'Skin Type Dry']",5 stars,12 d ago,no,,,One of my go-to blushes,"I bought this a while back after seeing Candice Swanepoel use it in her Vogue makeup tutorial and I have to say, I’m really pleased. It’s a bit different than I expected because the texture feels more like a lipstick, which isn’t typical for all over face products, but it stays put really well and the colour looks so natural and compliments a tan nicely. I don’t use this on my eyes or lips, but I think it’s worth buying just to use as a cream blush.

blush,STILA,stila Convertible Color,JHR77,Rouge,Rookie,"['Eye Color Blue', 'Hair color Blonde', 'Skin Tone Fair', 'Skin Type Combination']",5 stars,2 Feb 2020,no,,,BEST blush ever. period.,"Not only is the Convertible Color the best cream blush formula, it is hands down the best blush ever, period. It has the perfect amount of dewiness with the perfect amount of pigment and I just can't get enough. I've tried cream blushes from what seems like every other brand and I just keep going back to Stila. My favourite shades are Lillium and Peony. Peony is the perfect neutral for my fair skin tone, when neutrals usually pull too warm/brown on me, making my skin look ruddy. I've tried to apply this blush with fingers, brushes, and beauty sponges, but using my fingers works the best for me. After decluttering and downsizing my makeup collection to try to live more minimally in 2020, this is the only blush that made the cut. It's that good and I really can't recommend this product enough.

Very light and creamy, far exceeding the quality of the Tarte versions I tried to get her (they were very waxy). Natural looking and never patchy. Much better as a face product than lip product, but who cares when the quality is this good!!

But, on my skin it just looked orange. I don't wear a lot of foundation, but I also found this hard to work with-- it's really thick and almost rubbery. I imagine it would be even harder to work with if you had more makeup on. You have to tug at it a lot. Skip this and go look at Shiseido's whipped blushes instead. They may not be as purse-friendly, but they're wayyyyyy nicer.

However as long as you have clean fingers when you apply the compact will not get gross. The application is seem less you just put it on finger tips and rub in and pay down it has a nice semi dewy finish and super natural if you use a light application but it’s buildable. Best part it lasts all day or at least 8-9 hours. You can also use it in lips or lids kinda like a NARS multi stick but not as glittery and lasts longer.

The packaging is also great for traveling. Looks like it will last long as I only need small amount to get maximum result. Great product!

This product is super easy to blend into the cheeks with a beauty blender of fingers and the color is beautiful, but I find that I have to be pretty heavy handed when applying it or else it's easy to just blend into nothingness. I've also felt that it needs to be reapplied more frequently than I would like, but overall a staple of my makeup collection!

blush,STILA,stila Convertible Color,TheGarsowTwins,,,"['Age 25-34', 'Skin Type Combination', 'Skin Tone Light', 'Eye Color Green']",4 stars,11 Aug 2017,no,,,Camellia is STUNNING!,"We've been really into cream blushes lately and wanted to explore more hyped options. After some research we found that these Stila blushes have a cult following. We got the shade Camellia and it is absolutely beautiful. We would say it's an orangey brown shade that is deep enough to add some definition to our cheeks (on our skin tone). It leaves a beautiful sheen but does not stay sticky (something we hate about some cream blushes). We always apply with our fingers and that method seems to work best for blending purposes. The color doesn't last all day, we'd say 5-7 hours. The only other downside is the packaging, it felt extremely cheap and it was a lot smaller than expected. Overall, we'd highly recommend these and will be getting more shades!

I got it in Lillium after watching a makeup tutorial video, and it's a very standard pink color that'll look good on everyone. I have pretty tan skin, so the super bright blushes don't really show on my skin, but Lillium is perfect. I also love the texture, since it leaves my skin looking dewy and glowy. I am into japanese igari makeup at the moment, so I always use this on my cheeks just beneath my eyes and it gives me that youthful, young, innocent girl look. It's perfect!

I have been using Stila's Convertible Color for at least 15 years and it never disappoints. I have Camellia, Petunia, Poppy and Fuchsia. It takes very little product to give the perfect flush of color and easy to layer if you need more - it is lasting and so natural looking it's hard to believe. Whenever I stray and try other blush products, I always come back to this and remember why I've loved it for such a long time. When I wear Petunia I get tons of compliments because of how nice it makes my skin look. Other products come and go, but this one is a classic - have purchased this again and again and will continue to do so as long as this is made.
