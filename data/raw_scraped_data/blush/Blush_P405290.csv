It’s so beautiful, and when I saw my best friend wearing it, I ordered right away. This was the first Nudestix product I’ve purchased/tried so I’m new to the line. Pros: beautiful colour, easy to apply, comes with a sharpener Cons: felt sort of crumbly to wear, didn’t last as long as I expected. Overall I’d purchase again for the lovely shade, but me mindful that you’ll have to reapply more than other options.

blush,NUDESTIX,NUDESTIX Intense Matte Lip + Cheek Pencil,AdriChicago,VIB,Rookie,"['Eye Color Blue', 'Hair color Blonde', 'Skin Tone Light', 'Skin Type Combination']",5 stars,24 Apr 2020,yes,Color: Belle,https://www.sephora.com/productimages/sku/s1783802+sw.jpg,"Brighter than it looks on the pic, but SO GOOD","first of all, the pictures shown are not great. I have kiss and belle and both of them are brighter/ lighter in person. Kiss may look pretty mauve and neutral but its a lot more of a bright pink in person. Belle irl looks a little darker than the pictures provided for kiss. Just keep in mind the colors will be lighter than what the pictures show. HOWEVER THEY ARE THE BEST I have used kiss on my cheeks for months just about every day and it lasts so so well. as its a pretty bright pink I just use it on my cheeks but it looks like a great natural flush. Just bought belle, and I am over the moon as to the color. I have fair-light skin and it is the perfect pinky nude for me! it is so flattering as a lipstick and a blush! I generally dont like matte lips so I wear with a gloss or a lip balm because my lips are so dry, but I am definitely going to get a lot of use out of belle. You only need a very little bit, and it lasts all day, so I think it is a phenomenal value. Especially in the summer, as a blush this lasts all day and looks totally natural. 10/10!!

I have seen similar sticks before, but have never used the ones that are for both cheeks and lips. I tried this color on the lips first and it was a beautiful blood red matte lipstick. It was creamy when applying, didn't tug at my lips, was opaque/matte in one swipe, and it was also not too light or not too dark. I definitely see it as a cooler undertone. Next, I tried it on my cheeks. I rubbed a nickel-sized amount on each cheek and blended with my finger in an upward motion towards my temples and was surprised at how intense the color was! I definitely put too much, I think you could get away with a dime-sized amount or smaller. But, I was pleasantly surprised by how beautifully this blended and didn't look harsh. It literally looks like a lit from within flush. I actually took a nap in this look just to see the staying power and I'm happy to report after a couple of hours of sleep there is no bleeding outside of my lip line, the color is still on, and my cheeks still have color. I definitely will buy a full-size version in Raven and check out other colors as well!

However the price is expensive. Not all lipsticks are the same size but for example too faced‘s nude lipsticks are .12oz nudestix are .10oz and you sharpen them. I have other lipsticks that are .10oz but they aren’t in packaging where they get sharpened. So it’s less than .10oz for $24 which is expensive in my opinion.

I don't find it drying though I can't say it's moisturizing either, and I like that it being a pencil/crayon is like a built-in liner. I don't find any issues with feathering or bleeding.

If I had to choose, I would pick Vintage which works both as a lip and cheek color.

I was hoping that once it settled down that the sticky feeling would pass, but it took forever for the tacky feel to go away. It is somewhat long wearing. I ate lunch with it on, and I didn't touch it up, but blotting my lips (to remove the sticky feeling) would leave product on my blotting paper.

At 42, with those pesky lip lines, it was just too matte and a bit drying. It seemed to emphasize every line in my lips. But, I also had a sample of the Smashbox Always On Matte in Driver's Seat. The shades are extremely close to each other. Somehow, when I topped it with the Smashbox, it looked good. Plus, once the Smashbox wore off some, the NUDESTIX looked like a lip stain. But, I wouldn't buy it as a lipstick. On the other hand, I kind of liked it as a blush when applied lightly. I think it's likely a good product for those who want a very matte look. Just not what I look for. Maybe in another shade I might find it more ""multi-purpose""? But, I still wouldn't wear it on its own as lipstick. It does seem to do okay if I add another lipstick over it, but who wants to buy another lipstick to make another look like they want it too? To me, it's one of those ""works great on some, but not others"" items.

blush,NUDESTIX,NUDESTIX Intense Matte Lip + Cheek Pencil,TheBestAdvice,,,[],5 stars,24 Dec 2016,no,,,No cracking,This is such a great matte lip pencil. It gives you the same matte coverage as liquid lipsticks however it doesn't crack & gives you way more hydration. I have this one in Tamed and it's such a pretty colour. Love!,0,0,
blush,NUDESTIX,NUDESTIX Intense Matte Lip + Cheek Pencil,,,,"['Age 25-34', 'Skin Tone Fair', 'Eye Color Hazel']",3 stars,21 Dec 2016,no,,,"good for lips, not so much cheeks","I got this as a sample in my Sephora play box. I really like it for the lips. I don't really understand how you would apply it to your cheeks. I tried to put a little on my finger and rub onto my cheeks, but I wasn't really a fan of it in that sense. It is a nice color, and very creamy. It doesn't dry your lips out and it stays on very well!!",0,0,
