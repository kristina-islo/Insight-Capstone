I like that it has the two options: I like to use the lighter for daytime (such as work) and the darker for when I need to go somewhere in the evenings. I really recommend this, I’ve had it for a couple months already and barely made a dent in it, and for the price you can’t go wrong.",2,1,Recommends this product

I am so disappointed because alot of influencers rave about this blush duo but none of them mentioned any of this. The worst part is that I don't even have bad texture or pores but this made it look like I did. If you are on the fence about this.. . do yourself a favor and pass. Or try it in person first.

So when I saw that Jouer created this Blush Bouquet duo, I decided to give it a shot. The compact is ideal for keeping in your purse or taking for travel, and I think this ""mini"" has probably the equivalent amount of blush as a full size from other companies. Anything rose gold appeals to me, and I appreciate the tasteful, sturdy packaging. Jouer's formula is one of the best!

First the shades are not natural looking at all. I am medium neutral skin tone and the darker shade is terracotta. Like a clay pot. ORANGE. No one blushes orange. The lighter shade looked promising but it also looks weird on the skin. Second the formula. Dry, patchy and dull and blah. Last time I purchase this brand.

The second photo on Sephora’s site makes the depth look too deep, too brown, for the left side shade. It’s actually a little bit lighter. The right side is accurate, but doesn’t show the touch of shimmer and finely milled glitter in both shades. It’s very subtle so if you’re looking for a soft glow, this will do the job. The darker shade looks great in the hollows of the cheeks, and the lighter is so pretty on the apples. They blend together nicely too. All around, a great deal!
