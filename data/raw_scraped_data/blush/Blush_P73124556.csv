The color is lovely but the consistency is SO DRY. Like other reviewers mentioned it's truly impossible to blend and every time I use it I feel like i'm treating my skin harshly with all the pulling. i've started rubbing the stick on the back of my hand and mixing it with a bit of lotion to soften. Once stores open again I'm going to try and return. Very disappointed since the color and pigment is truly lovely.

At first I was hesitant when the Sephora Makeup Aritits grabbed this shimmer stick, but as I watched her in the mirror apply this stick to my face and blend in as if it was a blush/bronzer, I was completely in shock. I would have never on my own choose this color to use as a mixture of blush/bronzer glow. If you have a caramel/darker skin tone, this should definitely be in your makeup collection. I bought the stick the same day and now on to buying another one because I use this stick in almost all of my looks. This gives me that natural glow finish without the harsh red look that some blush products give, now don't get me wrong there's nothing wrong with the deep red blush look, it all depends on what look you are trying to achieve. But as far as a natural glow that brightens your face without overly brightening your face, you should definitely give this stick a try. Lastly I love that it is in a stick form, makes it super easy for application!!

They feel super lightweight on the skin, but provide great pigment. They aren't too shimmery or sparkly, but give you a glow that seems natural and is super pretty. I was amazed at how lightweight they feel for a cream based product. It literally is like putting a very soft textured powder onto your skin, but you're still getting that cream-like glow from within. They blend super easily too, but if you're used to applying creamier products with a brush, it might blend a bit too easy. I think it works best with fingers and a brush if you're super gentle or the pigment can disappear into the brush too quickly. I really like how they feel on the skin and I think they look beautiful. Plus, it didn't break me out or feel greasy by the end of the day. If you have dry skin, you may not like these as much and you may want a more liquid feeling cream product. Otherwise, they are great and I think the price point is good too.

This is NOT a creamy, dewy or wet formula. It has shimmer. It is cream to powder. Powders are generally dry. Please read the description before you buy. You wouldn't just dab on powder and blend it with a beauty blender... this sets down as a powder... use ur brush or fingers. It is best to warm on hand and then apply to face. I personally don't think there is too little product either... most sticks don't take up the whole tubing and it takes a lot to use this up. I am thinking the line will expand to different finishes -- like the PURRL stick being creamy and dewy. Please for the love of god read before you blindly buy whatever.

I thought it was going to be too dark to use as a highlight, but it catches light beautifully & actually works on my skin tone. The last color I got was Confetti.

I bought Ridiic, Unicorn, Yatch Life, Pink Lemonade, and Chili Mango. These colors are PHENOMENAL!! They are nothing like any other brand. I warm it on my hand, and apply it, and it melts into my skin, and is long-lasting. The shimmer is beautiful, and not over-powering (dewy look). The only flaw is what most people are saying, if you don't warm it on your hand, it does not go on smooth. I wish Fenty would just make another batch with a creamier formula. It would be a HIT because no other brand has this. They're magnetic, they have a matching magnetic brush, they are compact for portability, and the colors are amazing! They really need to make a creamier formula, but I guess they wont because enough people are buying these regardless of the flaw. I still love these! My favorites are RIdiic, Pink Lemonade and Chili Mango. Chili Mango looks great layered on Yatch Life. Yeah, you can layer these, and they look even better!

I am OBSESSED. I usually wear trippin or pink lemonade as a blush by swirling my brush directly on to the product then onto my face, but find that just going over my cheeks again with a sponge (w no additional product) gives it that ‘seamless flush of color’ look. I also use trippin, pink lemonade, starstruck, and sinamon as eye shadows by going in directly onto my eyelids then blending w my finger or crease brush. Then finally, I’ll use sinamon as a bronzer that’ll also give me that slight warmth and glow by using a brush to apply and sponge to blend again. I think it took me a while to figure out the best methods of application depending on how you want to use them bc sometimes going in directly onto my face with other products already on didn’t always workout for me, and I didn’t want to feel like I was ‘wasting’ product by having excess left on the back of my hand after having to ‘warm up’ the product.

It can be blended in with the fingers but I find that it lifts some of the product off my face and accentuates the texture in my skin. Overall its a great product and lasts really long.

Then I saw a technique of someone rubbing the stick on the back of their hand, taking a makeup sponge, dipping into it and THEN apply it that way. And holy crap was that the solution. It looks so beautiful, so natural on the skin (if you are dark skin lol) and I honestly went back and bought 8 more shades! So versatile.

Her shimmer matchstix I use for blush. I Love them!!!! The shade Beach Bump pulls more red on me, ( and I don't wear red blush because on my tan skin it looks like someone slapped me) but I do like this reddish peach. It is beautiful. All her products are amazing. MAC and Fenty are my top brands. And Rihanna did not disappoint with these new shades. I also picked up Pink Lemonade which is the perfect baby pink on me.
