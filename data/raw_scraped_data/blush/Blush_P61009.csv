It goes on smoothly, and the color, which I thought might end up being a bit dark, is actually perfect. I have gotten to the point where I am SOOOO tired of having the scrape out the last bit of my blush from their square containers, but I feel like I should b/c the NARS blush I used was pretty expensive. I loved the color, but I was just tired of having to work at getting the blush out of the container. I really do like this blush, and I will buy it again.
