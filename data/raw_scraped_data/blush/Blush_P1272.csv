I love the way it smells and even though my skin is very tan, it shows with 2 applications. You have to be careful not to leave it on too long after applying with the brush and before dabbing with your fingers. I usually apply 3 streaks/lines one cheek at a time and wait a few seconds before rubbing it in. I waited too long one time and my friend told me I had 3 lines on my cheeks and looks like someone scratched me! If I rub it in immediately after applying, it doesn’t show. It stains pretty easily and stays on my fingertips for a long time, even after washing with soap and water. Gives you confidence that it stays on your skin a while, but be careful splattering light colored sinks too!

People who say it’s trash don’t know how to apply it. This is a product that needs your fingers for it to work. Dab dab dab and if you want to build it up, swipe it on with the little brush applicator and dab some more. I first bought this because it was recommended by Alexis Ren (that beachy sun-loving girl on Instagram) and I was hooked. It gives you that natural sun kissed look. I really hope benetint doesn’t stop making this product because I wouldn’t know where else to look.

I bought it to add to my product collection of that glass skin type of look (which I could never achieve) and now I use it almost everyday. I use it on my cheeks under my foundation to give that youthful blush and I use it on my lips to give just a hint of pink having to reapply throughout the day. It's not very showy and loud like a scream stain but it just gives just enough color. I'm into the natural look so I haven't tried building it up but when I do have a little extra it looks nice and not overly powering.

I preferred the color of Benetint which layers to this awesome rosey flushed color that I love. I prefer the texture of Love Tint but the color was less natural/too pink for my liking. I’m mixed race African American and European/Caucasian. My skin tone is similar to Halle Berry or Beyoncé. I have a neutral undertone. My friend who has very fair skin with a cool undertone uses this same cheek stain and I LOVE it on her. Never in a million years did I think we could use the same shade of blush. We have different skin colors AND different undertones. How is that possible? I think this cheek stain might be magical... (I prefer the texture of Love Tint which is more like a cream. It’s easier/less messy to apply. Benetint (brush) is very thin and liquidy. Liquidy? That’s not a real word... I I didn’t realize Benetint came in the thicker cream formula with the doe foot applicator until I decided to post this review. I kind want to try that now. Assuming the two Benetint formulas are the same exact color I might go with the cream formula when this finally runs out... in like 5 years. Seriously, this stuff lasts FOREVER.

It is very pigmented (so you know you’re getting your money’s worth!), yet easy to lightly apply. In lighter layers, it gives my cheeks and lips a rose blush. In heavier layers, it gives my lips a bright fuchsia stain. It wears all day and is perfect for a fresh, naturally blushed look. To apply evenly to lips, I exfoliate first with a toothbrush. I leave them slightly damp so that the stain spreads evenly as I apply with the applicator. Then, I finish with a lip balm and I’m good to go! The smaller-sized (0.10 oz?) lasted me nearly a year with light usage. Absolutely worth the price!

The rosy color suits my skintone and looks very natural. I imagine it would be pretty difficult to mess application of this product up, so looking like a clown isn't something anyone needs to worry about. If I'm being nitpicky, I think the texture dries in a way that feels more sticky than I'm used to with liquid and cream blushes. This is only a very slight feeling of stickiness though, so it's not a deal-breaker by any means.

I have purchased 30 of these in my lifetime! I use about 2 bottles a year. I use it daily on my lips to give a natural flush of color, when my lipstick fades it always leaves something on my lips. As I color in my lips I also draw this a little past my natural lip line and it makes my lips loo a little fuller- in a completely natural way. I use this swimming in the pool and do hot yoga classes with it on too! It doesn't budge and doesn't dry your lips out. You can use it as a blush (gives a natural looking flush that powder blush doesn't quite do) but you have to use a TINY bit on your cheeks and work with it quickly. I prefer it for my lips personally and that is how I use it daily : )

Even then, I find that it's often too splotchy. It is, however, beautiful on the lips. It does require some trial and error to find the amount that's right for your skin tone, and sometimes it can look a little barbie-esque on my very pale skin. It does have an awful taste, but that goes away. TL;DR It's nice on the lips, but not on the cheeks. Requires some trial and error. Would recommend only buying the mini because its easy to use on the go for a flush of color on the lips.

I use it on my lips at all times, whether I'm wearing make up or not. I have also used it on my cheeks, and I really like the subtle rosey blush it creates. I can see it working for a wide range of skin tones, which is nice! I am giving it 4 stars because a) it has a weird taste (which is not unbearable but some people might dislike), and b) it can be a bit drying, which is annoying particularly during winter.

I've kept coming back to it because I know I can depend on it as a versatile tint for cheeks and lips. A little goes a long way, 2-3 dots on each cheek does the trick for me. I dab it on my lips sometimes too which gives the look of having just eaten a cherry popsicle. I also like to layer this with the Dandelion Shy Beam by applying the shy beam first the way you would blush and then blending a bit of benetint on top of of the shy beam. I use a little more shy beam than the benetint to get the right shade since benetint is more pigmented. it gives more dimension and an ethereal yet natural looking transition from the benetint color to the shy beam (which is more like a highlighter).

Most reviews say that it dries fast and this is true but if you do one cheek quickly at a time you’ll be left with awesome results.

I was previously using a liquid blush that is a pretty pink, but I’ve been wanting to try a deeper shade and this fits perfectly. You do need to layer it if you want more pigment and I think that is good if you are new to blushes like this. I can’t really use it as a lip stain since my lips are so dry and most lip stains never look good on me anyway, also I would say the fragrance isn’t my favorite for the lips, but it is manageable. I’ll be buying this when I run out of my sample. It seems to work great even over my luminous silk powder foundation, I’m not sure how other powders would react, but so far it blended nicely.

It’s a nice natural color and I actually had to do a few layers to darken it up. This is good if you’re going for a natural look. I usually line my lips and this looked totally different on my skin around the lips vs on my actual lips, which is why I said it will definitely only be used on my natural days.

I find that cream or liquid products can look so much more natural on the skin. This does dry fairly quickly on the skin, so work fast. I also find that if I put the brush directly on my skin after some use the bottle turns cloudy, likely from getting foundation on the brush. If I tap it onto my fingers then onto my cheeks this works much better and is nicer to blend as I don't get any marks from parts that dried down to fast. On the lips this is very drying and needs a gloss over it, and for me... I might as well just use a gloss. Also be careful, if the lid cracks at all, you'll get leaks if you put it in a makeup bag. Storing upright on a counter or shelf will allow you to keep the product, its just not as handy for me. This is an okay product, but I think I'll move on to trying something new next time.
