blush,KEVYN AUCOIN,KEVYN AUCOIN The Pure Powder Glow Blush,jenluvmakeup,,,[],5 stars,17 Aug 2017,no,,,Natura,"This blush looks like nothing special in the pan- but when you apply it, it's stunning. The perfect neutral blush, not too pink or brown. It really makes you glow in the most natural way. I am obsessed. I didn't think anything could beat my Burberry Earthy but this is just as subtle but gives more of a luminous finish. Kevyn Aucoin products never disappoint. I am definitely picking up more shades. The powder is so finely milled, very soft so it will kick up a little in pan but this formula will melt into your skin. It's not dry like some powders. Love it.

blush,KEVYN AUCOIN,KEVYN AUCOIN The Pure Powder Glow Blush,ashley0883,,,[],4 stars,6 Apr 2017,no,,,Helena,"This is such a pretty color! I am new to Kevyn Aucoin products and this did not disappoint. It is highly pigmented, which can be tricky with my fair skin, but I made it work. The color is so unique... a little mauve, a little peachy pink... not to mention the packaging is to die for! I will be buying other colors!",4,1,
blush,KEVYN AUCOIN,KEVYN AUCOIN The Pure Powder Glow Blush,lilypop21,,,['Age 25-34'],5 stars,14 Jan 2017,no,,,glowing from within,"This blush gives you a glowing from within look. I like to pair it with another deeper blush for contouring effects. Use this on the apples or upper cheeks for an amazing glowing blush effect (no glitter). I'm NC20 and chose Shadore, which was labeled as Soft Pink.",4,1,

I picked up Dolline and it has been love ever since. It's such a great everyday color and it reads as a neutral peach on my complexion. I love the way it instantly brightens up my face. I noticed that I don't really need much product either so I know this will go a long way. This product is super pigmented so be sure to have a light hand when you apply. I can't wait to try the other colors!

blush,KEVYN AUCOIN,KEVYN AUCOIN The Pure Powder Glow Blush,canuckglamgirl,,,"['Skin Tone Fair', 'Eye Color Brown']",5 stars,28 Dec 2016,no,,,A natural glow every time!,"I picked up 'Natura' a while back and I have completely stopped using other blushers.. This is the best everyday nice glow you can ask for. It's super blend-able and build-able so you can really make it as soft or as bold as you want. The formula feels like silk powder, it has just a touch of shimmer and people think I'm not wearing makeup, in a ""you look great... what did you do?"", kind of way. This is by far of of my favourite lines of all time, and this blusher is no less than amazing

It's a nice color with just the right about of shimmer, but no glitter. The not so good - this blush is highly pigmented. A little bit of this blush leaves a lot of color. I really have to blend in order for this blush to look natural and not streaky. I think this is a high-quality product, but should be used with a light hand. Not for the makeup novice!",5,2,

My skin is very fair - 1Y01 according to the color IQ from Sephora. Dolline is the perfect peach. Fira needs to be applied with a light hand, but is a lovely color. Both are extremely pigmented so you do not have to use much. It also lasted all day which is all you could hope for in a blush.",9,2,
blush,KEVYN AUCOIN,KEVYN AUCOIN The Pure Powder Glow Blush,emilley777,,,[],5 stars,23 Apr 2016,no,,,Favourite blush ever,"I purchased Dolline and it is the perfect peachy, apricot pink blush that I've been looking for forever. I've purchased many peachy blushes before but they are either shimmery (I prefer matte), too orange, too pink or too dark (I want a light colour). It looks very natural, very pigmented but not one of those too-pigmented and hard to use blush that becomes patchy when applied. It kicks up a bit of powder when I put my brush in but only a little. It is super blendable and buildable. What I absolutely love about Kevin aucoin products are their packaging too - this blush is sleek, very compact (but still comes with a mirror) and luxurious. I was pleasantly surprised when my blush looked freshly applied when I got home after wearing my makeup out for 15 hours. I am tempted to buy the other shades but the price is too high for me to collect a few :( worth every penny for Dolline though!
