I also just recently started wearing foundation, and when you wear foundation, that pretty natural flush us super pale girls get on our cheeks for no reason at all or just being outside in the cold or sun doesn't come through the foundation, and was really hard to replicate with any color blush, but this Strawberry matte blush comes pretty close to my fresh and natural looking flushed skin. It is really easy for blush to look clownish on pale skin, and this blush looks sort of dark in the pan, so I never would have picked it for my skin tone it if I hadn't seen it on a review on you tube - so glad I did because it's so pretty! So, if you're pale and looking for a good blush, definitely try this one!
