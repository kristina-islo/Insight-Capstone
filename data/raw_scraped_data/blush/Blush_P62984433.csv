The highlighter is very glittery and does not suit my skin tone. Granted, I mainly bought it for the blush and didn’t expect the highlighter to suit all skin tones. The bronzer does not appear on the skin despite it somewhat being close to what I want color-wise in bronzer. Blush was decent. It swatched better on the hand but you can’t always trust a hand swatch. I just expected more for the price. The packaging is nice though.

I would return but I waited too long. Its ok I will use it, the colors are good its just a bit frustrating to use. The bronzer doesn't make my fair to medium neutral skin look muddy. The highlighter is not too shimmery which I appreciate because I don't want to look like a disco ball. The blush is a pretty peach color. My only wish is that the color would be easier to pick up onto the brush. It will probably last forever due to this though so thats a positive. I don't notice any peach scent which I was looking forward to. The setting powder smells divine and that is what I was expecting. This palette is just a bit disappointing.

Very flattering. The color is a nice shade for fairer skin and has a beautiful luminosity. The bronzer is barely there but borderline orange. I have no idea who it would work for. It's too warm for fair skin (no matter your undertone) and not pigmented enough for the palest spectrum of medium. I use it as a crease color on ""no makeup"" makeup days just to use it. The highlighter? It's chunky glitter that doesn't stick. I don't prefer a glittery highlight but I could have used this as an eyeshadow topper if it had any stick. You need a glitter glue to get this to do anything. Even then it's patchy and glitter without much of a sparkle. It is literally the worst highlighter I've ever owned. I could almost forgive the crappy bronzer and highlighter for the beautiful blush that smells like peaches but for the price.....no.

I wear the born this way foundation in shades cloud & swan. I have no problem getting the pigments from this palette to show up on my skin but I wouldn’t likely recommend this palette for anyone with medium- deeper skin tones. The shades are buttery and buildable. They compliment each other and work for a cohesive look. And the palette smells amazing like the rest of the sweet peach line.

I tried it when it first came out in 2016 and it just made my skin shimmery. Fast forward to summer of 2019, the peach foundation and eye palettes are my summer favorites so I decided to give this palette another shot. Sad to say, the results were worse than I remembered. The colors look so pretty in the pan but do not translate well to medium skin tone. The highlighter is too pale, the bronzer doesn't even appear on my skin and I have to push really hard to get any of the blush to transfer on my brush. Once again it just made my skin shimmer. I could just buy shimmering powder for the same price.

I can wear this with a full face or with just some bb cream and mascara. It’s versatility and comfortability are definitely worth it in my opinion. I would give it five stars if it offered a wider shade range. I’m not sure how easy it would be to use these shades as a subtle highlight for people of darker skin tones in efforts of still “making it work”. It’s disappointing that this product, though good, can not cater to a wider range of customers.

I want to start off by saying that I have a medium skin tone, and all the products are perfect shades for me. I wish Too Faced would come out with a darker palette for those with deeper skin tones, because people shouldn't have to miss out on this. It also smells like peaches (if you are sensitive to scents) but the smell dissipates once it's on the face. I will go from the products left to right. Highlighter- Very shimmery. Not subtle, but not crazy intense either. I do like it, but I don't use it as much as I should. Blush- This has a very nice sheen, but it's in no way glittery or shimmery. It has a buildable color, so you can customize how pigmented you want it to be. It gives a very natural flush and a glow from within look. Bronzer- I actually finished THE ENTIRE thing. That has never happened to me before where I love a product that much. It is the right amount of cool and warm toned. It has a slight sheen, so it is not matte, but it is not shimmery either. All in all, I highly recommend this palette.

This is a darling product and smells delicious. The blush is gorgeous, sheer, buildable, and has a bit of a glow without being too much. The highlighter is just okay, it looks like it has the perfect percent shimmer, but it applies more glittery (its not terribly chunky, but not as rich and buttery as it looks in the pan.) The bronzer shade in this pallet is unusable for me. I love sheer buildable bronzers but this one is so sheer it takes forever to build and has a VERY strong yellow undertone, so I've reserved it for only those special occasions where I really want to look jaundiced.

You do need to dig into it to get some color payoff which is why I knocked off a star, but it’s really pretty and flattering. The bronzer shade is quite shimmery so you have to be careful not to overdo it. I usually use either the highlight or the bronzer when I do my look or else it can end up a frosty overload. The blush is not as shimmery as the other two powders in the palette. It’s beautiful but you do have to build it up to get color, however the pan is pretty big and it’s pressed hard so it’s lasting a really long time for me, I’ve used it on the regular for almost a year and the peach print is still visible on my pan. I have pretty fair skin (YSL all-hours in B20 Ivory) and the shade shows up on me but i doubt it would show well on much darker skin tones. I recommend trying it at a Sephora store if you’re not sure.

I love orange toned blushes but I often mix them with a pink tone to make the perfect shade... however with this one I already get the PERFECT shade! The highlight is amazing too I love that I have the option of a subtle glow or an intense glow! The buildable highlight is amazing! Already hit pan on all three shades and already placed a purchase for another one!

Take many many layers to build to a barely-there color. And I am very light with normal skin and no skin concerns. They’re beautiful shades but not worth the money. The blush serves more as a topper on other blushes but even then it hardly shows. The bronzer takes a lot to make it show. Not even pale or light skins tones like me can pull it off. The highlight is okay, it isn’t blinding and also takes a few layers to build it up to a subtle glow. It smells great but the scent isn’t overwhelming and goes away after it’s applied so nothing to worry about.

It smells wonderful, and the colors are just awesome! I am very picky regarding the normal pink blushes and bronzers which are too dark, because I usually prefer a more natural look to my cheeks, and my skin tone is light. A Sephora Beauty Consultant used this palette on me during a mini makeover, and I was immediately sold on it. I have seen complaints about the bronzer in this set being too light, but the consultant had first lightly applied Too Faced Chocolate Soleil Matte Bronzer to my face, then used the highlighting palette, which seemed to make the colors really glow. I always use both products together, and am able to get the look I am trying to achieve. I love the natural, warm glow this palette provides, and it works well with many different shades of eye shadow and lipstick for a complete look.

The blush is a gorgeous color and the bronzer builds nicely (on my skin tone though. It may not show up on deeper skins T_T). The highlight is also really pretty, however it's too dark to use on my cheeks. Looking straight ahead, theres two orange stripes planted on my face. Even though I cant use it for my cheeks, I tend to use a little above my brows, down the bridge of my nose, and on the tip of my nose to give my makeup a more glowy look. It also makes a nice eyeshadow (even if it has other uses, it is a setback to have a more limited use for a third of the palette that you're paying a lot of money for). I would say dont buy this product unless you go and test it out in store and make the decision then.

The “highlight” is also very, very subtle and doesn’t show that much. I have medium skin, closer to light. I wear a color 210 in the Fenty foundation and this palette didn’t do it for me. I wouldn’t recommend this if you prefer a more defined more noticeable color. This would be great for those who want a very subtle natural look. The blush was also very light very minimal pigmentation. I wouldn’t buy this again. I will be returning this product back. The sweet peach palette is very beautiful though.

I'm not sure why alot of reviewers are not enjoying this and complaining about pigmentation. I have fair skin but occasionally have light tan skin when I've gotten some sun, I don't really burn, just tan and this looks lovely regardless. I do recommend using a higher grade brush with this like an actual highlighter brush and a bronzer brush. I use the contour brush set from Tarte, the rose gold handle ones and they work nicely with this cheek and highlight palette. I really enjoy this palette, you just need to apply it properly with the correct tools. if you have a deeper toned skin, try using it with a damp beauty blender, the color payout will be more intense if that's what your looking for. This is also very buildable. Thanks Too Face & Sephora.
