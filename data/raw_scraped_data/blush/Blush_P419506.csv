Lousy packaging unfortunately.,"Good product but terrible packaging. From photos and videos I’ve seen of the product, it looks like it comes as a pump to apply but instead I received a screw off lid with no applicator, that I almost spilled completely when I opened for the first time. The top does not screw on very securely and it looks like it’s missing any type of applicator as if it were a sample in store. Very messy on the sides of bottle because so much product comes out at once. If this had come as a pump as it is shown then would have rated this 5 stars but as is, I think I will have to return.

I live in Texas and the hot summers mean that most blush doesn't last past the walk to my car in the morning. The liquid blush is the first I have found that will hold up to the heat and last the majority of the day. A little definitely goes a long way; I use only half a pump or less for both cheeks, and even then I have to blend it out significantly on my hand before applying it. It has a longer dry down time as well, so I have to avoid touching my face or using other products for a few minutes after applying. While I love the color and staying power, the complicated application process is not always worth it. I really only reach for this product if I know I will not be able to reapply my blush at a later point in the day.

Lovely color for summer to match a more bronzer makeup look. A tiny dab is all I need, and the glow stays for hours. HOWEVER, the packaging is awful. Something about the bottle being square doesn’t allow it to screw closed tightly, and I was devastated to see after having it just a couple of weeks that it spilled all over my makeup drawer recently. That’s an expensive blush to spill for crappy packaging! I should’ve known to store it upright when I noticed the sample bottle in-store had drips all over it. So very disappointed. Proceed with caution and make sure to store this upright and do not travel with it!

This shade is described as a matte dusty rose but I don't find that true because you can see fine shimmer particles on the skin but it looks nice. A little goes a long way since it's very pigmented and it's lasted through very humid and hot weather. I would recommend powdering it for longer staying power but I have been able to wear this throughout all four seasons. There are definitely more affordable liquid blushes that have a great formula as this but this product will last you a very long time. I find it looks best on bare skin or with a little bit of makeup under.

The product is a bit runny which makes it difficult to apply especially since I’m not that skilled. The product also sets very quickly so there is little room for error or correction. That being said if & when you get the application just right it is definitely worth the effort. It looks phenomenal & has saying power unlike powder blushes.

It can be scary working with liquid blushes especially since you don't want to end up looking like a clown, but this product really gives you the perfect rosy cheek! One pump is more than enough! Id even suggest using half a pump since a little bit is all you need, I like to apply this blush first and then go over it with my foundation, this way it gives me a more subtle look. This works so well with a beauty sponge and really gives you a pretty finish!

Overall it’s really nice, easy to apply. The only down side for me was I just could not see it on my cheeks from the pictures I took. It also didn’t last so long maybe about 4 hrs and it’s faded out. I love being able to see my blush I don’t use a lot of makeup so the blush for me is just like a pop of color for my face. So I’m giving it 4 stars it’s really pretty so I would recommend it. I wish it was more pigmented or maybe that’s not the issue, because I did pack it on but I just didn’t think it lasted that long. I really love the color. I love Nars products so I might purchase some other Nars blush but I had to return this because for $40 I didn’t think it was worth keeping as I don’t have that many blushes so I wanted to buy something I would be able to use more.

Three stars taken away because of the terrible packaging. So much product was wasted because the pump dispenses with barely any pressure, using an index finger to pump, you end up with three times the amount of product that you actually need. The lids of both bottles never stayed on and when they constantly fell off in my makeup bag, the pump would hit something like a makeup brush or an eyeshadow pallet and liquid would end up all over the inside of my makeup bag. It was a mess! You would think for the cost of this item NARS could at least invest in some quality packaging, not the cheap bottles these liquid blushes come in. I wouldn't purchase again unless the packaging changed. Washing my makeup bag and cleaning every item in that bag, over and over, got old, fast.

I've been debating between this and benetint for a long time now, for a long lasting liquid blush, and this seemed to get more consistent reviews. it DOES NOT last long on my face. It stays on for about 4 hours and then fades, and if i accidentally touch my cheek it very easily wipes off. It's also hard to apply and is very messy. the color is pretty but if you're looking for longevity, STAY AWAY.

However this was not always the case. First of all, when I first got it, the top was so stuck I didn’t know it had a pump. About a month in I looked at reviews and realized I don’t have to be turning the top off every time. Stilll, it is extremely hard to use a little bit at a time and I’ve began just pumping onto the finger and then using a dense buffing brush to grab it and to blend on the cheeks. Take the excess on the finger and put on eyes or lips for a monochromatic look. The color is gorgeous on my olive skin and this little bottle is going to last FOREVER at the rate that I portion out the pumps. Great formula, lasts all day and extra works perfectly on the lips.

That's why it gets anything above 1 star. This would get one star otherwise, due to packaging. I have no idea what happened, but at some point the cap decided it didn't want to couple with the glass container anymore. It simply refuses to go on in a manner that actually closes the container. Because of this ridiculous issue, it made an absolutely monstrous mess which was luckily contained in a plastic bag, since I had it on the plane. I thought ""well shoot, maybe the pressure screwed with the formula and it leaked."" Nope! It's the cap. Now I have half a container of this product (which I've used so little of that you couldn't even tell it was used by looking at the liquid level), blush all over the outside of this product and a ton of my other makeup products, and the cap won't even go on so I can close it. This is such an asinine issue for an expensive, famous makeup product to have.
