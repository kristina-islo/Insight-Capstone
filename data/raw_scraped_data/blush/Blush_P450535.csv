Now I’m regretting not getting the full size haha. The color is so flattering and the payoff is awesome. I love tarte pressed powders (shadows, highlight, contours etc) because of how soft and blend able they are. This blush does not stray from that! Applied fairly goof proof and blended beautifully without grabbing onto any texture. Looks good both when I’m super pale and when I’ve got on self tanner. Give it a shot, you won’t be disappointed.
