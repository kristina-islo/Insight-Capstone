It has the slightest sweet scent to it that goes away, and it blends beautifully into my skin whether I’m wearing foundation or not. I’ve been using cloud paint from Glossier before this for a few years, and I’ve loved it but this is better! It blends out much nicer and I like that I can use it on my lips too. Unlike the cloud paint, you never get too much product. The metal applicator is lovely. I just squeeze the tube gently and rub the tip of the applicator in a circle on my cheek, and then blend in with my finger tips. I will be repurchasing this!!

I would say the finish is a bit on the matte or satin side, which I love with my oily skin. I now have two colors- stutter and before today, and find both of them flattering and beautiful.

The tube is much nicer, and it comes with an applicator that allows you to not only apply this as a blush, but also a lip color if you so wish. I have pigmented lips and it is quite difficult for me to find a multi-use products for both lips and cheeks that enhances both. When you first apply this product you have some time to blend it out or work it into your lips, and then it sets but does not dry you out. It lasts on my cheeks for about 4-6 hours, but reapplying it is very easy. I am able to blend it out over a light application of powder later on in the day if I need to. Most sephora locations do not carry this product, and I was actually surprised that 'waking up' was my perfect shade b/c I had originally gone in for ""stutter."" I have also used the Ilia blush sticks before, but I think this one lasts longer, and it is even more beautiful.

On lips, it works best over an SPF layer or a chapstick base because otherwise, I’ve found it to be a tad drying. On cheeks, it just takes a tiny dab for a good flush of color that’s subtle and natural looking.

If you are familiar with the cloud paints you know they can be tricky to apply just the right amount. These are very sheer and buildable! Plus the color waking up is EXACTLY what I was looking for.

The texture is a little smoother and dries almost immediately once blended. I layer this on top of the Kosas tinted face oil and don't find that it moves or fades more than my other powder blushes. this color in particular is quite pigmented, i find i need to be careful on the cheeks or i end up with too much pigment. But its nothing a beauty blender can't help blend out. I find that on the lips is where i need to build the most, I apply a layer, let it dry and then apply another layer to strengthen the color. This is super nice with a lip liner underneath, I use MUFE 5C with a lip gloss on top of everything. I also use this product as an eyeshadow base, not sure if we're supposed to but i do anyway. Its really pretty in the crease with a shimmery gold on top. I have even used this to spot fix my fake tan in a pinch. This product isnt really for heavy makeup wearers as i dont think you would get the intensity that youre looking for but if you like cream products, multi use products or a no-makeup makeup look then this will be a delight for you. plus its clean at sephora! I really hope they bring out more colors as this color and the darker pinky red are the only ones i would put on deeper skin tones and i dont know if their would be a cast or not. Hopefully they can bring out some deeper colors!! would love a deep red brown and a true plum.

As a blush this was awesome, it doesn't patch, it doesn't disturb the rest of my makeup and it stays on up to 12-hours. As a lippie the colour is great, starts off very glossy and takes about 30 minutes to dry down. As an eyeshadow it creases pretty fast but if you set it with another shadow or a clear powder it stays on for much longer. There's a very small scent-- kinda like vanilla and musk but it's VERY minimal, don't let that deter you. Zero flavour. It isn't transfer resistant but I'm fine with that. This has very clean ingredients, it's vegan, cruelty free and most of all, works great as a multi-purpose pigment. It's pricy in my opinion but it's amazing.

I usually don’t like the look of cream blush—powders just blend out more subtlely. Looks more natural...Until one day you turn 55 and realize your skin will not let you wear that charming powder blush. Your skin’s too dry and sensitive, and is more reactive as you age. This happened to me, so I ordered two colors: Before Today and Waking Up. ILIA’s new products have simply beautiful shades and rich pigmentation if you choose to max out the color. For me, a tiny tiny trace takes care of my whole face. On the apples of my cheeks, forehead or bridge of nose and cheeks, or to help lightly contour. These colors are brilliant, they fo cheeks AND lips, and it just wears exquisitely on young and old alike. But it’s like a 3-week vacation for us somewhat older ladies, because we have a lot drier, more wrinkled skin. I always hated liquid or creme blush, but ILIA’s changed all that for me. I look forward to full-makeup days so I can enjoy my nice glow! I had to leave off a star, though, because the product is sort of portrayed as being in a reasonably sized tube. At this price I don’t expect or appreciate a tube of blush/lip pigment being the size of my pinkie finger. It was represented as much larger in ads and marketing. Caveat emptor, I guess. Look before you buy. But another great thing about this double-duty pigment. It can save you money on buying two different products—with ILIA’s pigment you kill two birds with one, and you look great. A small amount lasts a while, so it justifies the price, for me.

It’s the perfect amount of dew. I would not really say it’s matte but it does dry down nicely and does not feel sticky at all. It smells incredible! By far my fave item from ilia. I feel as the integrity of the product will be much better since it is in a tube rather than a stick or pot like many cream blushes.,8,1,Recommends this product

However, I found this one is slightly more matte than glossier, but still give you an soft glow since its a cream product. Personally, I like the glossier one but cannot see it as a multi-use product, since it looks a bit patchy on lips. (dont get me wrong cause I had three of them and love it!) But Ilia make the purpose, although its on a much pricer side, the velvety silk finishing on cheeks and lips is stunning and comfy. It really does what it calm for, and for upcoming summer, its one of the top choice, love it : )

The color is rich but can be applied lightly for a natural look. The texture is so smooth and creamy that application is easy and hard to mess up. A little goes a long way so use just a tiny amount until you are used to it. I bought Temptation after much deliberation because all of the colors are beautiful and pretty universal across skin tones. I’m definitely buying a couple more now that I know how amazing they are. The price is a little high but it’s worth it and one tube will last a long time.
