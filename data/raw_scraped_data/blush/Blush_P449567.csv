blush,BENEFIT COSMETICS,Benefit Cosmetics Benetint Cheek & Lip Stain (6mL),Wolfgirl22,Rouge,Rookie,"['Eye Color Hazel', 'Hair color Brunette', 'Skin Tone Porcelain', 'Skin Type Combination']",5 stars,2 d ago,no,,,Use with a lipstick! :),"I have been using this for years I still have the older design that came in a much bigger bottle. I am happy to see that they are selling it in a smaller bottle with a more realistic price point! I have been using benetint for 10 years and it's well worth the money it looks great as blush and lip tint however if you want to amp up your lips add a lipstick on top (I particularly enjoy it with bond girl) when the lipstick wears off you will still have a nice color on your lips because of the stain :)

I haven’t tried it on my face other than my lips. It leaves a nice tint, which is perfect during these mask wearing days as lipstick just smears all over. Don’t apply too much at one time or it will run into your mouth and it doesn’t taste good or smear outside of your lips. If you have lines around your lips then this may not be a good option for you as it will probably leak out into them. It’s very watery so be careful when applying or you will make a mess

I'm not a big fan of lipsticks. I prefer a natural type of lip product and something that lasts long all day. I love red colors though, and this red is not too bold and not too dark. It is a bit drying on the lips but I apply lip balm on top and the stain will not come off when you do this. Overall, it is a perfect stain for your lips and the color is amazing.

The result is a much more natural dewy looking pink tint than with a pressed powder or cream/stick blush. I also use this on my lips and one light swipe is enough to instantly stain the lips. However this product makes lips extremely red and leaves them very dry. I recommend using a balm on your lips under this before applying.

It is my daily cheek blush and I use just a little on my lips and get great natural color. I'm a bit concerned because I just ordered more and it looks like there may have been some tweaks. I don't like tweaks. But I am hopeful it will be the same great product. Did I mention they said i was 'glowing'?

Yes.,"This is the best lip stain you can buy. It's the only one that lasts and doesn't vanish as soon as I start the day. It's very easy to build up to get a bolder color and it doesn't transfer when drinking coffee, or smudge! I do miss the brush applicator it used to come with and I wish I could still find Lollitint, but I will keep buying this product as long as Benefit keeps making it!",1,0,Recommends this product

While the color lasted, I gave it only 3 stars b/c of how much it bled. I have to stand near the blow dryer and dry each layer or it bleeds into all the creases on my 40-something year old face",1,0,

I don’t know why I never gave this a chance but I finally did! This is the best lip tint EVER! It gives you a natural rosy/red lip. It’s not a gloss finish (which I dislike) so no sticky feeling or product balling up! The product smells like roses too! It’s liquid, like water and when applied it just seeps and blends into your lip. I like to apply a normal lip balm first and then apply the Benetint in the center of top and bottom lip for the Korean faded lip look. The product is also buildable if you want more color. I have not tried this product on my cheeks...I don’t think I will, I only wanted this for my lips.

Unfortunately it just doesn’t measure up. The colour is nice, but the product is very watery (as opposed to more of a gel texture) making it very difficult to apply, and difficult to build any colour. Staying power is quite poor, and the coverage is very blotchy (even when I exfoliate my lips). I really wanted to ditch this product so I could stop supporting MLMs, but I guess I will be going back.

I have tried a ton of different brands, but this one is the best one for me. It is basically a liquid, so it goes on very easily. You can put chapstick over it without it smudging or wearing away. It doesn't taste bad, and it smells like rose water. Since its just a tinted liquid, you can either make it very light and natural by just putting a little bit on and smudging it around, or you can make it very dark by putting on a few coats and letting it dry in between. I'm in love with it and will definitely buy more when I run out.
