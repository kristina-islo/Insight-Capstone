This shade is the perfect natural looking peach shade I've been searching for. There was a great shade like this that Revlon use to put out, but it was discontinued years ago and it was my perfect shade. It's been at least ten years since that shade was discontinued. I'm so excited to have found this shade. This is the perfect shade for fair or light skin tones. If you hate wearing pinky pink blushes like I do, then this is the perfect find.

Deep Throat is such a perfect wash of colour that leans warm peachy pink, looks like a healthy glow- very natural rather than make up. I also have orgasm and due to the shimmer in it feel is more suited for evenings or special occasions. Deep Throat has shimmer too but very minimal, noticeable only if someone is standing very close to you. Color lasts the entire day- does not oxidize or go patchy, does not highlight texture or pores. Will not only repurchase but look at more colours available to see if i can find another favourite!!

I'm very particular about what I put on my face and my make-up is primarily clean and green. I have yet to find a company that nails the pigmented blush game better than Nars. Thank you, Nars! I purchased Savage (blush) about a month ago as I switched my hair color from longtime blonde to a darker brunette and needed to update my every-day shade of blush. I used Nars' Torrid religiously on the daily with my blonde hair. I'm light-skinned and using this blush with an ultra light hand works. Don't let application #1 daunt you if you put too much on! Buff it out and start light and layer it up next round. Grateful to have this as my long wear, daily go-to in the blush department. This blush also looks great with a minimal face of MU as the color adds the right amount of ""punch"" yet doesn't make you feel like the rest of your face is missing.

I've dropped many of these over the years, and the blush shatters every time (although the mirror doesn't). And the way it shatters is almost impossible to fix with alcohol and re-pressing it.
