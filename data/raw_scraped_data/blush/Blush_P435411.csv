I will say the Twilight looks more like the it does in the pan picture than in the swatch picture (I don’t think you could get it that pink), it’s like a less reflective and slightly peachier Nars Orgasm. It definitely has this lovely glow from within quality without adding any satin or shimmer finishes. My only complaint is that this is a very tiny amount of blush, and it’s not very hard pressed so it’s a bit more powdery and you use more product that in a Dior or Hourglass baked-like formula. I’m also not a fan of the packaging, which kind of comes across like I’ll-fitting/ matches cardboard and not very luxury. Also please note that while this is cheaper than other luxury brand blushes, it’s actually roughly 1/2 the size :(

It’s beautiful, long lasting, and easy to work with. It seems that some reviewers are under the mistaken impression that these are blushes. They are not. The only two that would work as a blush, on most skin tones, are Twilight Hour and Berry Dawn. Solar Haze is a great blush topper, lid color, and highlight. It has just a hint of a peachy base color that gives your a healthy glowing flush to your skin. Shimmering Champagne is beautiful too. It has almost no base color, so it can be enjoyed by almost everyone. If you read the description, and know what you’re purchasing, you won’t be disappointed.
