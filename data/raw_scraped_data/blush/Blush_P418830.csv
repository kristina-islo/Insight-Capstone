When swatched you can get some pigmentation but when applied with a brush (I just use a real techniques) it mostly applies as a luminous highlight with the slightest blush tint. This works for me because I'm super pale and terrified of having paint-by-number pink cheeks, but I don't think it would work as a blush on medium or deep skin tones because the pigmentation just isn't there.

Twice. NOW, Baby Doll is AMAZING. This came in the mail as a TRUE blush with some highlighter effects. Exactly what I wanted. Blush and highlighter combination, as advertised. Ciate London is one of my favorite brands, but some of these items are too much highlighter and very little blush, and they should really aim to make it a true mix. I don’t know how other buyers’ Baby Dolls turned out, but mine came out exactly as I had hoped. Just would be great to see more consistency with other shades. I know it’s supposed to be random, but it’s frustrating when you have expectations.

blush,CIATÉ LONDON,Ciaté London Glow-To Illuminating Blush,RunDream,Rouge,Rookie,"['Eye Color Blue', 'Hair color Blonde', 'Skin Tone Porcelain', 'Skin Type Oily']",3 stars,17 May 2019,no,,,what you see is not what you may get,"I’m a little unsure. While this is indeed a gorgeous product, it’s also not consistent. I purchased Baby Doll and In Too Deep. Now, Baby Doll has A LOT of pigment and is a true blush, while In Too Deep turned out pure highlighter. The reality is, these are a combination of blush and highlighter, which is a brilliant idea. But the thing that kinda sucks is it’s random which ones will have more blush and which ones will have more highlighter because they have that baked-type of effect, like Laura Geller blushes. When I bought In Too Deep, I really wanted to have a lavender blush, as it’s described. I ended up receiving 99% highlighter in the compact- no lavender at all whatsoever. Meanwhile, YouTube videos feature In Too Deep with more lavender. So it’s purely random which you will get! Being a reasonable person, I get that it’s luck of the draw and random which you will get, but it’s also somewhat frustrating if you go into buying these with heavy expectations. If you are happy to get blush or highlighter and aren’t picky, you will love these. Because they are very cool and fun. If you are particular about preferring blush versus highlighter, I would say these are risky and you most likely will not get what you want. By the way, they are VERY small. I would recommend these if you aren’t picky.

Medium tone For some reason in my mind, this was a lot bigger than what was received but it didn't stop it from being a great Blush and Highlighter in one. Plus I like the cute packaging. I might have mistaken it for the CIATÉ LONDON Glow-To Highlighter size. The first time I used it, I couldn't see the blush that well and the highlighter stood out well (applied with a brush). After reading some other reviews, I ran my brush over it for a bit longer than usual to break up what feels like a film of just highlighter particles to get to the blush. It worked great! You only need a little bit and it lasts the entire day and night! Hasn't caused any break outs or random things like that. Stayed on as a dream. For the price point, it feels expensive for what you see. The blush is nice and subtle and the highlighter component is also subtle. As someone who's new to the make-up scene, I feel like this is one of those great and rare 2 in 1s (since I generally avoid 2n1's at all costs). The small size is great for travel and is quite light weight which is perfect in a minimalist kit.

This blush provides both color and highlighter without being overdone or looking like a glitterbomb. The highlighter is a finely milled shimmer. I dont like spending too long applying makeup so I find this product is like hitting two birds with one stone. Its a nice time saver and a great blush. I use a real techniques blush brush (white handle) and I have no problems picking up enough product with each use. The packaging is cute and I think theres plenty of product to last.

I’ve been searching for a blush that I actually like for over a year now, since I had never worn it before. Every time I tried one, it just looked unnatural and unflattering to me. But this one was perfect!! When you swatch it, it looks glittery, so I was nervous. With a brush however, there was no visible glitter on the skin, just a beautiful sheen that does wonders on my dry skin. Keep in mind that if you like really pigmented stuff, this probably isn’t for you- I have to do a couple layers before the color is enough for me, but I like that since I’m very fair and not experienced with blush. The blush is also small compared to most, but I don’t think anybody would need more than what it provides. The color is beautiful, and I couldn’t be happier with it.

There is no glitter in the product but there is a ""lit from within"" glow that comes from the blush. I found that it doesn't emphasize texture and it blends very well. When compared to Coralista blush from Benefit, Coralista is more orange and is less smooth. It is very pigmented and only a little is needed on my fair skin to reach a peachy flush to the cheeks. However, the blush does fade after five or six hours. It doesn't disappear completely but the vibrancy and glow do fade. I love the blush so I don't mind that it fades a bit but I do have other blushes that last longer. The packaging is adorable and sturdy. The blush is very tiny but I like the small size for travel and storage. I docked a star for the product fading but I love everything else about this blush.

I'll admit I have three of the five shades: Matchmaker, Babydoll, and Summer Love (my fav!) I've worn them for months now, and I highly recommend to those who want a perfect swirl of matte blush and highlight. Since these are a baked gelee formula, you have to use a stiff blush to apply... but once upon the cheeks, they look so light,radiant, and natural! Every single Ciate blush is uniquely produced and customized. I initially bought Babydoll, then Summer Love, and finally Matchmaker. The only reason I haven't picked up the other two is because I have way, way too many blushes, but I definitely was tempted. $26 is pricey for a blush, but I don't spend my money unless I really like something... and these do not disappoint on any level.

blush,CIATÉ LONDON,Ciaté London Glow-To Illuminating Blush,yuline,,,[],5 stars,1 Aug 2017,no,,,Love Date night only,"I have date night which I adore and use almost everyday. Thank goodness the stores at one point had testers for all the shades except in too deep because I got to swatch and experiment with all the colors. I can see where some dissatisfied reviewers are coming from. I only like date night and to me it's the best shade with lots of pigmentation and it performs consistently for me whether it was tester in store or my own purchase. It imparts a beautiful and glowing sun kissed look. Warm toned. The shimmer is perfect and not chunky but present enough you look glowing like starlight in daytime. You don't need a heavy hand. It stays a good 6 hours about before needing touch up. Once you put it on, you can't mess with it like don't rub it or add a setting spray (apply after setting spray) or it will come off. Maybe I should have given it 4 stars because I only adore date night and in too deep looks like it would be stunning but it's been out of stock and unavailable forever. The other colors are disappointing whether in shade or pigmentation. Package is cute but I wish it was bigger and you had more product and it was embedded deeper in a pan. I noticed testers in store had the whole product broken clean off because it is not embedded deep into a pan in terms of packaging so I make sure to handle mine with care since the packaging may not hold up to rough handling. Please stock in too deep and keep carrying date night!!!

Definitely a contender for my wedding blush, and I'll be buying more. Great product for summer in particular, especially if you're going for a JLo sort of glow (which, lets face it, we all are).

blush,CIATÉ LONDON,Ciaté London Glow-To Illuminating Blush,KitKatPat,,,[],5 stars,16 Jun 2017,no,,,Lovely Flush that Really Glows,"I took a gamble and purchased matchmaker and date night after seeing someone wear this blush. Never having worn Ciaté, I didn't know what to expect. Yes, the blush looks on the small-side, but it's about the quality and not the quantity. Also, how often does one finish a blush before it goes bad? Cosmetics do not last forever, people. Back to the blushes, they are absolutely stunning to look at in the compact, which is beautiful. The colors are divine and you get a long-lasting glow. It's a pretty glow, not blinding, but better than the Nars Orgasm shimmery blush and yet not as sparkly, gorgeous as the blush in the Tom Ford Solar Exposure palette. Date night is a beautiful apricot neutral color, while Matchmaker is a beautiful pinky coral. These two colors go nicely with pretty much any eye look that's on the warmer or the cooler side. Also, they do pair up nicely with a highlighter, so don't think it'll be too much. Moreover, they don't emphasize texture on my skin. They are great for travel and they apply beautifully with the fingertips since it has an almost creamy texture. The swirl of highlighter makes it perfect to use multiple shades of this blush on the eyes for a subtle, almost two-tone eye-look. Just dip your fingers in there and you'll see what I mean! Generally, I use my fingers and/or stiff brush to finish the look depending on whether I am wearing powder foundation or liquid foundation. For those of you who think it's too sheer, use your fingertips or a stiffer brush. You'll be surprised by the results. I recommend this product and would like to purchase all of them. I think they are perfect for the summer when you want your blush to last through the heat and humidity. I prefer these over the NARS multi-sticks, which are great too, but the Ciaté blushes probably won't melt or break in travel during the summer heat.

Therefore, I am keeping the 2 blushes. I am returning Date Night because the color is too warm for my taste. It is much more pigmented than the other 2.
