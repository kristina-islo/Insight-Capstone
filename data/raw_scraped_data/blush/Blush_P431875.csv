Most highlighters look darker than my complexion calls for, especially in a set/palette. This product doesn't disappoint! Both the blush and highlighter suit my skin beautifully. It's long-lasting, and has a shimmer finish for a lit-from-within glow. Not to mention it's the perfect size, when I'm traveling for work or fun I'm never without it! If you're concerned about the size of the mini, don't be. I've had this for over 6 months and haven't even made a noticeable dent yet (mind you, I wear a lot of different products, but given that this is a frequent go-to, that says something).

However, I've owned it for about 5 months now and have only used this maybe 3-4 times. I just never reach for it. I think partly the blush is a tiny bit dark for me (I'm very pale) so requires a light hand and good blending, and most days I'm slapping make-up on and out the door with as little effort as possible, and the texture of the powders feels a bit chalky to me and hard to blend. Definitely prefer my Hourglass minis. The packaging is really pretty, but overall this wasn't enough to convert me to ND powders.

Im standing there looking at all the goodies they have in mini sizes and I saw this face duo and thought.... Pull the Trigger! And im so glad I did. Pros: Beautiful colors Applies easily Not powdery looking at all Packaging is gorgeous Strong packaging that wont break powder during travel Long lasting User friendly- its buildable so you don’t over do it Cons: Price per gram Packing can show finger prints so it needs wiped off after use.

I have never tried anything from ND and I loved how tiny and compact this was… perfect for travel. The blush gives a subtle pinky glow and the highlighter is shimmery but not over the top. This is a perfect everyday duo, great for work. It likely won’t show up well on folks with darker skin, so beware of that, but suits my fair skin quite nicely. It’s $23 Canadian which isn’t cheap but to be honest I’m fine with paying this extra for packaging that won’t break after I’ve used it for a month or two, like a lot of drugstore packaging seems to do for me!

I have so may of her blushes, but i always come back to this one. The softness of the crushed pearls in it makes it that much more radiant. If you’re looking for a soft cheek or a total wow bam cheek for a major face beat, this little blush covers all your look creations.

On my pale skin, it's just enough to bring me back to life! I was worried that the highlighter would be too dark, but it's the perfect champagne for me. Some reviews complain that it's not pigmented - I definitely disagree! I've used this blush as a crease/transition shade on my eyes when doing a really simple monochromatic look. I did use another foiled/shimmery champagne eyeshadow because I wanted an intense shimmer on the eyelids, but the highlighter in this palette is the perfect blinding glow for the face without being sparkly or emphasizing texture. I have a tiny scar on my cheekbone and somehow this even smoothed it out and made it way less apparent. I really love this mini palette and, although it's small, I've barely made a dent with regular use over the last few months.

Remove the top layer!,"I totally understand why people give this 1 star and why people give it 5 stars. It is definitely a matter of getting the product going for it to actually work. I bought this on impulse since it was such a pretty little package and was so upset when I went to use it and there was literally NO color. Like seriously, none. This is definitely where all the 1 star reviews are coming from. BUT... after seeing it on my vanity and wanting to get at least some use out of it, I decided to read through some of the 5-star reviews to see why the people who loved it gave it such high praises. One reviewer wrote that you had to get through the top layer before the product gives some color payoff. I took a brush that was a little more coarse and really scraped off that top layer. Then when I took my blush brush and picked up some of the layer below IT WORKED! It actually has a ton of color and I actually had to wipe some off my cheeks to make it more subtle. I got a beautiful coral color and the highlighter is dewy but natural. I am so happy I saw that one review because this is now one of my favorite things to keep in my purse for touchups throughout the day. I saw a lot of reviews said this must only be for very fair skin tones, but I am definitely a deeper olive color (Latina) and this looks lovely on my skin tone too. I really think it is a matter of getting that top layer off. If it weren't for that hiccup, I would have given this 5-stars.
