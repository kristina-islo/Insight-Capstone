blush,SEPHORA COLLECTION,SEPHORA COLLECTION Contour Blush Palette,LolaRennt,VIB,Rookie,"['Eye Color Green', 'Hair color Brunette', 'Skin Tone Medium', 'Skin Type Combination']",5 stars,5 Apr 2020,yes,,,Cannot beat this quality for the money,"I really cannot believe how much I love this palette considering how cheap it was! My go-to right now. Nice range of colors and pigmentation (not every one is like BANG, but I prefer a more natural blush and this delivers) that fits a wide range of looks and moods. If you are drawn towards peachy blushes this is for you- the colors are gorge. The blend-ability is not exactly consistent (the top middle I find to be super pigmented so gotta be careful) but it definitely helps to apply to a powered surface and not directly to a liquid foundation base (i think this is true of any powered blush). Highly recommend.

blush,SEPHORA COLLECTION,SEPHORA COLLECTION Contour Blush Palette,mkmeyer11,Rouge,Rookie,"['Eye Color Blue', 'Hair color Blonde', 'Skin Tone Medium', 'Skin Type Combination']",4 stars,26 Feb 2020,yes,,,Good palette.....but too many shimmer shades,"The matte blushes in this palette are really pretty....especially when you mix them together. For some reason I thought there were more than 2 mattes, probably bc there should be. If you like blush with a bit (or a lot) of shimmer than you will really like this palette bc all of them are good quality. I am not a huge fan of shimmer on my cheeks, but I have been using the shimmer blushes on my eyelids everyday and love it. It gives just a little bit of something to the eyes on the days I don't feel like doing a full face but still want to look slightly pulled together. All and all, I like this palette.....great addition to my blush collection. However, I would NOT pay full price for it....it is way over priced. But, if it is on sale it is totally worth it.

If you can afford a good quality bronzer brush, grab one as it will better deliver product to your skin. Also, try blending one or more colors together to create your signature look. The lower far right highlighter is very close to Nars Orgasm blush, and mixed with a bit of clear lip gloss, looks so pretty! These are multi-use pans, not just blush/bronzers. Several will work great for a monochrome look, especially for spring and summer. Very happy with this purchase.

I have tried everything; a different brush, different color combos, more/less application. I just don't like it and I usually like Sephora products. The shimmer is ugly, the colors are just OK.

Blush can be a hard thing for me to wear, as I tend to go overboard and look too flushed, or it's the first thing to disappear from my face. These go on perfectly and it seems hard to over apply. The top middle one is my favorite everyday, and I even use the top right one as highlight when I don't want the aliens in outer space to see me. Some days, I just dab into all of them honestly. They make great eyeshadows for a quick look too.

It has blush shades for all skin tones. It has a beautiful gold and bronze shade which I love. Its a great quality palette with enough pigment that you don’t have to continue dipping your brush to get a amount of blush like some other palettes which don’t show at first. For every mood or occasion this palette is there for YOU. Great size and fits in any makeup bag just fine for makeup lovers who like to do their makeup on the go!

blush,SEPHORA COLLECTION,SEPHORA COLLECTION Contour Blush Palette,Jasmine93738,,,"['Eye Color Brown', 'Hair color Black', 'Skin Tone Fair', 'Skin Type Dry']",5 stars,15 Nov 2018,no,,,Peach heaven,"I have been eyeing this product for the longest time as I love the peachy, ""Nars orgasm"" type of shade range in this palette. However, I could never bite the bullet to pay full price even though its so low for an entire palette. So when the annual vib sale came, I snatched it right up and I have no regrets. This palette is way better than what I was expecting and I am a blush fiend. So much so that my blush addiction might not be healthy. Anyways, this palette has become my everyday staple as it easily blows every other blush out of the ballpark with its perfect peachy but natural rosy flush. It is just the most stunning shade if you are a fan of peachy blushes. I will definitely repurchase this once I am out.

OMG! I'm obsessed! I already bought the spicy market palette and loved it. Ended up coming back for this babe too. It's not only affordable, but it lasts on the skin as much as many high-end ones, and the hues are gorgeously flattering. Why paying same price or more for one blush if you can get 6?Package says ""for all skin tones"", but it is not quite it. I'd say it's a great palette for fair/medium. For deeper skin tones I'd recommend the spicy market. It is absolutely stunning. Sephora really hit it with these blush palettes.

I wish they would have had 3 matte and 3 shimmer blush and no bronzer as not everyone uses bronzer or countours, but i got this on sale an have used it a couple times and i am liking it. It doesnt settle into my large poores, or texture andbthe colors, evennthough a bit different then the photo, still works and the quality is there. Plus i got it for a ""weekly wow"" at 14.00 and for that price you should pick it up andnhave it in your collection. if Sephora does another pallette, ALL blush would be be great and do 3 mattes and 3 shimmers. The shimmers is not glittery or leave glitter chunks on your face, and the pans are really large size. Glad I picked this up on sale.

It's pigmented enough for my NC 18 skin, the colours blend nicely, and the top left pan works as a subtle contour. These blushes are nice as eyeshadows as well. I think you can achieve a fairly natural look with these with a light hand. If there was a lighter highlight shade it would truly be everything in a pan. While I have many palettes I keep reaching for this one. User friendly, on trend colours for fall - whats not to like? I've tried far more expensive palettes that don't deliver like this one. I think it would be gorgeous on medium skin tones as well. If you're on the fence just buy it. Especially if you have warm undertones and want a nice co-ordinated fall look. Way to go Sephora.
