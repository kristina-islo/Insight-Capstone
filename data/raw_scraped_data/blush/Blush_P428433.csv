Little goes a long way, so start with little product and work it up. I like how the cream blush has it’s own cover so fallouts won’t mess with it’s beautiful color.

I was a little hesitant based on the cream highlight looking quite deep, but it is lovely and gives a very subtle glow. However be warned that the diamond highlight is nearly pure glitter so this may not be the most practical for some. I have oily skin and I am able to use the cream products no problem. They feel more like a gel than a cream. Both blushes are a tad warmer than they appear on the website. The lighter cream blush is gorgeous on the eyes since it is a duochrome pink/gold for those who do not like it on the face. I would not purchase full price, but with it being discounted and getting an additional VIB sale 20% it was a fantastic deal for so much product.

I cannot explain the love that I have for Darya, so much so that I went to N.D. website to purchase the Citrus as well. The packaging is heavy enough to feel luxurious while feeling light enough for your arm not to get tired, its perfect, as is the compact and aesthetic of this palette - none other is like this one in my collection. The colors in the pan look far more intimidating than actually are on the skin. To start, I have red, textured cheeks and light yellow undertones and was skeptical these pink blushes would be too cold to look good on me. I was wrong. Both blushes are warm, extremely easy to work with and are not intensely pigmented, they are buildable and look like natural blush on the cheeks. I use a duo fiber brush for the cream blush and have had 0 issue same as a beauty sponge, although I do have to say that this is one of the palettes that you will need to be cleanly with as sometimes the cream can jump to the outer rim. The highlight formula is ridiculous, I don't typically love cream highlights but the N.D. formula is changing my view, it looks so natural and glistening as a base and even on its own. The powder highlights are as blinding as the ripples of waves in the sunlight if that makes sense. They do emphasize texture but not in a way thats chunky or chalky or not skin like, it is beautiful on my textured cheeks, and when I turn in the mirror I could stop traffic. The duo glow highlight is so unique and adds such a special effect as it warms up the icy highlights with a pink gold shift that adds to the palettes versatility. I like the diamond powder, I don't use it every time I pick up the palette but its a great bonus if you're feeling extra, and its not glittery or have insane fall out on the cheek, it stays put and doesn't look chalky. In summary, out of all my luxury cheek palettes, this is the true diamond in the rough.

The reason for the mediocre review is one of the highlight colours. most of them were subtle, but the diamond powder shade was just... chunky glitter that didn't even match the colour it looked like in the pan. super weird. I purchased this product when it was 50% off, so the price was totally worth it. But I wouldn't pay the full price for this, there just isn't anything that special about it.

However I've been using it more lately and now I quite like it. I use my fingers to apply the creamier products because this seems to give a better look than a sponge or brush. I like the diamond cream to give a subtle but very natural looking glow and use it alone or layered under matte powders. The cream blush is really nice layered under the powder blush in the palette or any other powder blush. I like the yellow cream to put on my eyelids where it seems to have a cool duo chrome effect and looks stunning when layered under touch in sol sun aurora (which has a similar looking gold- green shift). The blush is mostly shimmer but still pretty. Anyway I'm giving it 3 stars because the top three products in the palette are good. The highlighters are ok but better suited to a cooler skin tone than mine. I would not buy this full price but on sale it is not a bad deal.

If you didn't know, the top row is CREAM and the bottom row is POWDER. The creams have a clear plastic flip-up cover to keep from being contaminated by the powders. This is awesome, and it WORKS. The palette is much larger than it looks in the photo, and you get a fair bit of product. It's also quite weighty, and feels well made. Both formulas are smooth and richly pigmented. Her blush formula is absolutely AMAZING; I'm not quite as keen on her highlight formula, which has more chunky glitter and less blinding shimmer. I personally don't like creams mixed with powders, as creams will expire long before powder, so half your palette is suddenly rendered useless space. I prefer powders to creams, but her cream formula is like a 'cream to powder' and works great over dry medium, like setting powder or powder foundation. You don't have much time to blend this way, so you need to use a light and careful hand if this is how you apply it. Overall I've been enjoying these palettes and what they bring to the table.

If I use my fingers it works as a highlight but otherwise won’t budge. I’m literally only keeping this because the other highlighters are sooo pretty especially the yellow (I was so scared of that one because I’m very fair) is like a tint of yellow with an amazing duo-chrome effect. The diamond highlighter powder is actually very creamy and came looking broken HOWEVER I literally could press it back into the pan as if nothing happened because of it being so creamy. Might just exchange it and see if I have better luck with the powder blush with a different one because the shade is gorgeous it just won’t pick up.

This one was my first and I use five of six shades but not always at once--I think I'd glow too much if I did. Like in her others, there are cream and powder formulas. I use a small brush or a sponge with the cream formulas and pounce or daub the colour on so I don't disturb my foundation. The powders work well over-top or on their own and; on top they create a glass finish with the two combined. I love the glitter highlight on the lower left, and it is glittery, but I use it dabbed on my eyelids over a neutral flesh toned liquid eye shadow such as Stila's Nude Awakening. It just give a opening 'pop' to my eye, and never looks overdone. If you use this on your cheese you get a wet glittery finish, whic is also lovely. As with all NDs cream blushes, they are very pigments so start with very little on your brush/sponge and build it up. I rarely use the DIAMOND glow cream, as I prefer Charlotte Tilbury's Hollywood Flawless Filter--no product can touch that one, IMO.

I am not a fan of the glitter one but it does work great as an inner eye highlight. The creams are stunning and powders blend out so nicely. I would not pay full price for it tho, just don’t think makeup should cost that much imo but at half the price this is fantastic and will be the only blush and highlight palette I will need to travel with, love it. The cream highlight especially is my fav, it looks so natural and adds such a beautiful glow to the skin.

The 2 cream products are awesome and the powder blush was nice, but nothing special in my opinion. The two regular highlights didn’t make me glow so much as sparkle, which is not the effect I’m interested in. You can layer allll the product for more of a glow but it wears poorly throughout the day and you’re left with chunky glitter on your face. The yellow highlight is unique but not something you can wear every day, except maybe on your eyes. I was expecting more finely milled highlights for the cost of this palette. I ended up returning it and exchanged for another blush product and highlight.

I love blush but I always have issues with blushes having patchiness or being too matte/dry looking. These blushes in this palette were the answer to my prayers! The powder blush isn’t a true matte but it’s also not like a pick highlighter either, it give the cheeks a nice sheen almost and it makes your face look healthy and alive. The cream blush was a little intimidating to me at first but it’s honestly one of the easiest cream cheek products to use! I use the Morphe M427 Tapered Duo Blush Brush for the cream blush and it applies it effortlessly and helps me to not go in so heavy handed. I like layering the blushes but I also like them separately as well. Now the highlighters. The Diamond Powder (the extra glittery one) is really pretty but not my favorite personally. It’s definitely not a highlighter for the faint of heart. It also brings out the tiniest bit of texture from the skin but it’s not unbearable. I like the cream highlight, it adds an almost dewy, lit from within glow. I especially like layering the cream highlighter with the the powder highlighter in the bottom right of the palette. It’s soooo long lasting and it doesn’t look too crazy but it’s obviously there so if you don’t like a highlighter that WILL show up this palette is not for you. Anyways, I’m in love with this palette but I’m only giving it four stars because of the CRAZY price point (before it went on sale) and also because I see myself never wearing the duo chrome shade or the diamond powder. But other than those things I’m so happy I waited for it to go on sale before buying it and I absolutely love this palette!

I'd give four stars considering the half price I got it, which means if this palette is sold at full price I can only give it 2-3 stars. It's still nice but not up to my expectation. The color range and idea is very good, but, it's just not pigmented as you'd think it should be. The hight lighters are not that shining as some other highlighters, and it won't last long. It'll disappear after just a a few hours. I am not that into the cream base products either. It'll be a little challenge to use both cream and powder together on your face. Therefore basically the two cream-based pans are a waste for me. I would only use the other four pans. The one I indeed enjoy is the ""duo glow"",which is indeed very beautiful. That's it. This palette only worth it if on half of its original price. I'll always have to think twice when purchasing any ND products considering the mixed reviews.

So I was so excited to try this one! However, there’s something weird with the formula of this palette. I’m not sure if I got a dud or what? But the cream blush goes on nice and then as soon as you put any sort of powder on top it gets so patchy and never fully sets down? And the highlight does not show up at all. Very weak palette. Not worth the price. I would recommended the Love Glow first and the Bloom second but I would not recommend this one.

I didn't realize it was the same blush color. I do feel these are really great, but one is geared more toward lighter skin tones and the other is for darker. I thought they worked for both (They can). but they seem to have the same blush color. This must have been created as the same type of palette for different skin tones in mind. versus being two completely different sets. I can't make sense of the same blush color with both otherwise. That might be good to know for future purchasing. I do love my Darya and have been using it daily. The diamond face powder feels more like a night product and has too much glitter for me during the day. I looked like a twilight character or the tin man. It would be gorgeous at night. But the highlight worked quite well. It can show texture if you have a lot of texture, but I'm almost 50 and I didn't feel it enhanced that in the least. It was a good highlight. There are two cream based colors (another highlight and blush) with a lavender shift glow (in Darya) - The cream highlight is very toned down and the lavender highlight feels special occasion for me or an eyelid topper shade. (I used it as that and it was quite pretty) The diamond face powder is more of a topper type of powder and can be used anywhere. The powder blush is meant to go on top of the cream (I think so, they match) and the powder highlight can be used on top of the cream one or alone. This is a fantastic face palette and very much so for the sale price. The quality is there with this. The Citrus one is pretty too, but he highlight is too dark for me. I have light skin and I can make it work with a tan, but the Darya seems to suit me better. The bright yellow in citrus is gorgeous and as with Darya, it's a glow with a shift and can be used however you wish. I love the cream bronze in citrus. I just wish the blush color was different. I could condone keeping both if it were. Great palette, catch this while it's on sale!
