blush,BENEFIT COSMETICS,Benefit Cosmetics Georgia Blush Mini,Lanikalei415,,,"['Hair Condition Curly', 'Eye Color Brown', 'Hair color Brunette', 'Skin Tone Olive', 'Skin Type Oily']",1 star,16 d ago,no,,,this doesn’t show up on skin,Honestly very disappointed with this one because I’ve always had the best luck with benefit cheek products and when I saw a peach blush I was like yeaaaaaaa and I got the mini and I went to put it on..... it didn’t even show on my skin but it showed up when I swatched it but glittery so I thought blush topper but just beware this won’t show up on your skin,0,0,
blush,BENEFIT COSMETICS,Benefit Cosmetics Georgia Blush Mini,CrystalNiuChen,Rouge,Rookie,"['Age 25-34', 'Eye Color Brown', 'Hair color Black', 'Skin Tone Fair', 'Skin Type Combination']",4 stars,25 d ago,no,,,Not my fav color but still a nice blush.,"When i got the product, it was darker than i thought. So, i started with a very light layer on my cheeks. I could only see shimmer, but almost no blush. Then, I put more on, it did look more peachy but ...with a yellow-ish undertone (not sure if it was only me...)? Anyway, for sure, it does not bright up. I agree with other reviews that it works better as a topper. It also works well when i want a no make-up looking. It would look like natural blush on my skin and i can save the highlight. I am with light skin with yellow undertone.

There was no better blush for the pale than Georgia! This is her flashier cousin from down South. It has a shimmer to it that is... fine. I can wear this over Spring and Summer, and it reads okay on camera, but I personally would have preferred the OG.",8,1,Recommends this product

But this did not show up on my light skin. I wouldn’t recommend on med or dark. It’s perfect for fair skin. The palest of pale. I wish benefit would step up their game of being inclusive.",25,10,

It was one of my first HG products. Bringing back the name and packaging in an entirely different product is annoying and disappointing. Just call it something else.",35,6,

I was so excited to open this and catch that old familiar smell. However, I don’t remember it smelling so much like plastic. It seems a bit more shimmering as well. Very light wash of color- pretty but may return.",22,3,
blush,BENEFIT COSMETICS,Benefit Cosmetics Georgia Blush Mini,JessBCda,Rouge,Rookie,"['Eye Color Blue', 'Hair color Auburn', 'Skin Tone Fair', 'Skin Type Combination']",4 stars,4 Mar 2020,yes,,,Pretty flush,"I'm light-toned and love peachy blushes (pink just makes me look ill), and usually prefer creams. This has a nice, smooth finish that sets it apart from other powders - it lasts but doesn't settle in my pores. The shade may be tricky for very fair tones but you don't need much at all. My all time favorite is still Gold Rush but I'd buy this again. My only complaint with the mini is the brush is awkward - I have to use a bronzer brush to get in there.

Unfortunately it just didn’t show up much or lost very long. I applied it in the morning and after being at work for an hour it was gone. Really wanted to like it.

Your personal beliefs do not warrant giving a product you did not try 1 star. It’s a beautiful blush very subtle but pretty.

blush,BENEFIT COSMETICS,Benefit Cosmetics Georgia Blush Mini,OhSoBlonde,Rouge,Rookie,"['Hair Condition Dry', 'Eye Color Blue', 'Hair color Brunette', 'Skin Tone Fair', 'Skin Type Combination']",1 star,26 Feb 2020,no,,,"Come on Benefit, do better.","Ugh, I wish that I could even USE this blush. I take what I put on my skin very seriously because I don’t want the makeup I’m using to break my skin out. I always check the ingredients of every makeup item on cosdna and this product, just like every single one of their other face powders, contains a few ingredients that are level 4 (high level) acne causers and skin irritants. Before I knew about checking products I was using their Hoola bronzer for contouring, and I didn’t understand why I was getting breakouts in the contoured areas. Now I know better. If you have acne or are prone to breakouts, buyer beware. There are plenty of other companies who don’t put acne causing junk into their face powders, I don’t know why Benefit can’t catch on. Hard pass.
