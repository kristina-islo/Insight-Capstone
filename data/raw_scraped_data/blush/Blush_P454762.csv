It’s not glowy as in super radiant and shimmery so I feel like the wrong words are used to try to describe this blush. It has a tiny sheen, I would say. I have both the coral and pink colors and if you’re very fair to fair and you’ve always dreamed of using these bright colors, this is the blush for you. If you’re medium you might be able to build this up with a proper dense goat haired brush. If you’re skin town is deeper than a medium... I don’t know if you’ll have any luck with this product which is why I’m giving it a 4 star because I feel like these are marketed as universal.

The color may look scary and almost clown like in the pan but it gives a realistic ""just in from the cold"" flush. As others have mentioned, this is a very small blush but a little goes a long way and there's no kick up, which can waste product. I can't put this blush down and highly recommend it.

It is not a healthy glow finish, it is more like a matte. The packaging didn’t impress me, but I was surprised that it has a mirror inside. The size is very small and the price is high even for other versions on the market that are bigger. I bought it to replace a Bobbi Brown trio of bronzer/peach blush/highlighter. Sadly this is only the peach blush with a matte finish. The only good thing is that I like to layer products and if I use the Dior Holographic highlighter I have a close result to the Limited Edition of Bobbi Brown that I wanted to replace. That’s the reason that I won’t return it, but I don’t recommend that you invest in this blush, at least that you are looking for a matte finish. Sorry Dior, but I felt that I was cheated...
