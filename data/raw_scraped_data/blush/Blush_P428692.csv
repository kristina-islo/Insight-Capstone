I'm super impressed by the highlights, they're super smooth, buttery, and reflective as shown in the attached picture. They are not glittery at all, just have a subtle shimmery sheen and are very pretty. The blushes (except for the hot pink one) don't show up very well on my skin tone in swatches but on the face they come off decently pigmented and none of the powders have a ton of fallout or anything and blend easily. This is a palette which is worth much more than it sells for,and grabbing it for $8 is a steal, even if you only use the highlighters on the eyes or for Halloween. All three blushes and the pink highlighter are quite wearable (depending on your skin tone) and for the price I would highly recommend picking this up if you're looking for this type of thing.

The third blush is the only one that is pigmented. The pink one is lighter and less fushia/purple than pictured. They are soft but not buttery and can be a little chalky when you need to apply a lot of product to build up the colour. I love two of the highlighters. The blue one is harder to use because it has a blue/ grey cast when looking forward, at least on fair and light skin. The first one is a nice green/ champagne highlighter ,not too green and no cast. The last one is an iridescent pink that could be compared to a tone downed version of KVD Pink Opal. The blue is a bluish/violet/grey. Very cool tone as every other highlighters in this palette. Ofc nothing is holographic but I think for its price sale of 8$ cad it is a must have. Highlights aren’t as pigmented as other coloured highlighters on the market but it also means they are easier to work with. If only the blushes interest you I would skip it because you kinda forget they are there... they also blend a little patchy.

The shimmer is very fine and the highlighting looks quite natural. The brown colour is good for contour and the pink and red work as blushes. They blend really well. The blushes have a decent staying power. The highlighter fade earlier, which is fine for me as I am not a big fan of highlighting. I hate looking like a beacon.

All blushes are bright when layered but can also be more soft. The highlights are very cute and are as holographic as a highlighter can be. The blushes don't stay on the whole day though, and I find myself often touching up in the bathroom (I don't have a setting spray, perhaps it would stay on better with one?). The only colour that I have a problem with is the middle blue/purple highlight. It is too dark to be a highlight for pale people but I think it would look great on darker skin tones. I can still use it for eyeshadow though so it's not completely wasted. I do not think this product is worth $35 (Canadian) so if you want it, I'd wait until it comes on sale.

To be fair, it was my first palette so I had nothing to compare it to. But now that I have been using makeup more, I recently got a new palette and it is definitely not as pigmented as this palette. The highlights on this palette have definitely set a standard for me in regards to pigmentation. I just need one application of highlight with this palette and it’s perfect! While with my other palette, I need to apply at least 2-3 times. I don’t really use the purple or pink blushes as I have a red undertone and I find that the blushes bring out my cheeks too much. The warm rose blush though is perfect! My absolute favourite blush. It can somewhat act as contour for me which is great because it looks very natural on my skin tone. I would love to purchase this blush on its own if it exists.

Formula wise highlighters are better than blushes. Both are blend and layer well, 1-2 layers without primer they're last about 6 hours before faded. Highlighters are smooth, nice pigmentation, not accentuated pore, no glittering which I really like. Most unique shade is the soft light gold with bright green shift. Blushes are also smooth and a bit powdery. Pigmentation is quite soft (not scary as in the pan), but can layer to more intense. Most unique shade for me is the magenta in the middle. Attached is a picture of 2 layers finger swatched. Part of blush swatches have highlighter layered on top, so you can compare between using blush highlight and using blush by itself.

Positives: - Different blushes: orange (more brownish and I actually use as a bronzer), pink, red - Blendable, and need only about 3-4 taps on my brush to get enough for my preference - Great price for the amount I get Negatives: - The blue transformer looks weird on the blushes

I feel like when I'm done with the 3 pats I can use, I'll have to give the rest to my black friend with blue undertones in her skin. Great if you wanna split with an opposite skin tone friend, but bad if you wanna use the whole thing. On the plus side, the 3 pats that work with my skin tone are really great and I love the yellow highlighter and the coral blush.

The Anastasia kit had the best iridescent glitter of them all and survived the wipe test the best but the pigment didn't really show (except for the pink) and that's what I was looking for with these palettes. While the glitter isn't as good it is comparably cheaper and offers the pigments I was looking for. The holographic stick had more of a shimmer and not a glitter. The pigment was great but did not survive the wipe test. The pigments in the sephora kit also look way better in person than it does in these photos. The blushes are also great if you happen to be someone who is fairly pale in the winter and then moderately tanned in the summer. There's enough range that I can see myself using all of them at some point.

They are totally wearable on an everyday basis so long as you aren't too heavy-handed with them (any blush/highlighter will look unnatural and unwearable if you overapply, I find that the opposite applies as well!). Personally, I really enjoy what a light sheen of blue contributes to my otherwise subdued/natural everyday makeup. There are definitely creamier and more finely milled blushes and highlighters out there, but you can't beat this price!
