They’re much bigger then I’d expected and SO easy to use. It takes no time to put on and save me a nice amount of time when I use these instead of shadows or different liners... They’re the exact same shade and brightness as the color indicators on each crayon... They last all day, and come off with ease whenever I take off my makeup. I love these. I’ve used them every day since they arrived.

Found It!,"Not just a typical eyeliner. These are vibrant, LONG wear, bright af, pigments. Kat Von D knows what she's doing with makeup. When I swatched these on just the back of my hand, they were there for 48 hours.. that's with multiple hand washing! I finally had to use an oil based makeup remover to get the swatches off. Not sure I'd use these in the waterline, but as a liner to add a bold pop of color? Heck yeah!

It’s in a flimsy zip bag, so when I received it in the mail it was open and only had one of the three crayons in it. It looks like it’s meant to be properly sealed so a consumer can cut it open but the manufacturer never bothered to heat seal the top as you can see from my photo.",10,24,

blush,KVD VEGAN BEAUTY,KVD Vegan Beauty Crush - Technicolor Crayon Set,poupee2518,Rouge,Rookie,"['Eye Color Brown', 'Hair color Black', 'Skin Tone Light', 'Skin Type Dry']",5 stars,10 Apr 2019,no,,,KVD Technicolor Crayon Set,"Most KVD products are failed for me, but this set is surprisingly cool. Products are made in Italy. Intended for use as face paint. Only Electric Blue has an eye-safe symbol on it. Bubblegum has Red 28 which is Fluorescent color, and Red 7. FDA is not permitted for use in products intended for use on area around the eye. Wild Orange has Red 6 which is also not permitted for use in products intended for use on area around the eye as well. Red 6, 7 are approved to use of these coloring on lips, so this is more likely same as you are applying lipstick or face paint color which has Red 6, 7, and 28 everywhere on your face including eye area. I tested all 3 colors on my eyelid anyway (not inner rim), and results are no allergic reaction, no crease, creamy and pigmented (swatches are same as shown on the website), set fast, and last all day. These crayons need powerful cleansing oil/cleanser to remove, pink and orange need double cleansing as they might leave stain. Also when I mix blue pink, they create a bright cute pastel purple :) very fun and versatile set to use. I am happy with this purchase.

It lasted maybe 30 minutes however nothing stays on my waterline. the orange and pink states that they cannot be used on the eyes. not sure exactly what these products are supposed to be for since Kat Von D has not stated anything about these products. maybe they are supposed to be used on your face for theatrical looks? all three are super creamy and pigmented might try the orange and pink as top eyeliner even though they say not to be used on the eyes.
