blush,NUDESTIX,NUDESTIX Sunset Nudes 3-piece Set,Victorious18,VIB,Rookie,"['Eye Color Hazel', 'Hair color Blonde', 'Skin Tone Light', 'Skin Type Normal']",5 stars,4 d ago,no,,,The price is right! I love it!,"I really liked this set. You have everything you need for a full monochromatic look. The eye color is a glittery orange/coral color and soooo smooth on the eyes with no skipping. You have some time to blend it in before it sets. And when it sets, IT DOESN’T BUDGE. I wore it for over 8 hours and it did not even crease! The lip color is also very creamy and hydrating. It is a pink nude that’s more on the peachy side. I thought it wouldn’t fit me since I don’t really wear peachy colours but I liked it! I also think that the two crayons are VERY reasonable in size. They aren’t actually that smaller than the full sized ones. You will not go through these quickly, especially the eye color, because it is pigmented and you don’t need to build it. I’m glad I didn’t have to buy the full sizes because one crayon is $32 CAD which is the price of this set itself. I wanted to try this blush colour but I didn’t want to pay the full price if it wasn’t going to fit my complexion. I already have another Nudestix blush so I knew how the formula was going to be like. When I saw this colour in the set I immediately bought it to try it. Yes, the blush is a bit small, but again, it IS blush, you won’t need much of it. And you won’t run through it quickly unless you wear orange/coral blush everyday. I am glad I got to try it, it gives a nice flush on the cheeks, I think it’s great for summer! And yes, it is long wearing, just like their other matte blush formulas. I am really satisfied with my purchase. I hope Nudestix comes out with more 3-piece mini sets like this with one. I really love their brand as a whole.

blush,NUDESTIX,NUDESTIX Sunset Nudes 3-piece Set,loud,VIB,Rookie,"['Eye Color Green', 'Hair color Red', 'Skin Tone Fair', 'Skin Type Normal']",4 stars,12 d ago,no,,,,"This is an awesome little set. All of the colours are very flattering and blend out beautifully on my fair-warm skin tone with or without foundation. The eye pencils all set themselves quickly so you have to act fast with them; I also find they blend best with a finger. This colour is a peachy-orange and not like anything I had before so I am quite happy with it although the picture shows a more brown tone. Not mad, just something to keep in mind. I sheer it out over my eyelid as I find it QUITE orange, but that peachy tone is just so pretty. If I used concealer to prime my eyelid, then the pencil creased, but if I used it on a naked lid, it stayed all day. The lip pencil is creamy and I can’t wait to try it out on my cheeks as well. The all over matte face colour is probably my favourite, it’s a bright rosy coral thats perfect for the summer. Such a pretty sun kissed look that I am in love with. It’s not super matte so you can set with another blush if that’s what you’re looking for but it leaves a natural, slightly dewy finish. I gave it 4 stars as you will have to reapply, it fades a bit on my skin but I also cuddle puppies all day.

I love the orange/coral, peachy eye color, it's bright and fun, or tone it down by sheering it out with a brush or ur finger, or put it on full boar and put a champagne highlights in top. all blend nice and comes with sharpener and cute lil tin, great set.",2,0,Recommends this product

Colors lean on the burnt orange for a bronzy monochrome look. All products have good pigmentation that can be sheered out or built up to your liking. Textures are buttery and give you enough time to work with before they set. Really happy with this!,3,0,Recommends this product

The eye color is nice, although a little more coral-colored than it looked on my screen. It lasts fairly well on my extremely oily lids (on par with other Nudestix I've tried). The lip is a really nice nude color. I probably wouldn't buy the blush again as I found it a little hard to blend, but I will use it. Overall this is a nice set to have. The colors were perfect for my light-to-medium skin tone.",11,0,Recommends this product
