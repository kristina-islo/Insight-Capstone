I used Mahogany as a bronzer for my skin tone, I thought it was too light, but it actually works about perfectly. For shade reference, I am a Fenty 450 or 460, MAC NW55

This is actually my first purchase of a blush palette. I’ve always been hesitant to purchase because It seemed like a waste to only use 1 or 2 colors out of a full palette. But THIS?!? I find myself reaching for this everyday! I have used every single color: contour, blush and highlight in one palette. Colors are so buttery rich and pigmented..this one is a brown girls best friend. At $28 this is less than $5 for each shade and trust me this will become an integral part of your daily makeup routine. Andrea Renee’s YT reviews brought me here but the quality of this palette will keep this a staple in my makeup collection.

Unlike buying a different brand palette that has so many colors I wouldn’t have used. And it was very affordable! I rarely buy new products outside of my basic makeup routine products but this I’m so glad I bought.
