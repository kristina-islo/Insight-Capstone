blush,NARS,NARS Mosaic Multi-Shade Highlighter & Blush,brishubert,VIB,Rookie,"['Eye Color Hazel', 'Hair color Auburn', 'Skin Tone Fair', 'Skin Type Combination']",4 stars,24 Apr 2020,yes,,,First Nars Purchase,I like this product when I'm in a rush and want an all in one flush on my cheeks. The only downfall is it's very pigmented. VERY. You have to go easy with it if you have a lighter skin tone. Overall it looks beautiful when I apply it lightly. Would recommend for tan to deep skin tones.,2,0,Recommends this product

But the first mosaic I purchased broke into pieces. Sephora allowed me to exchange the broken one for a new one. The second one also broke. This product just separates/breaks too easily.",5,0,
blush,NARS,NARS Mosaic Multi-Shade Highlighter & Blush,Holly104,Rouge,Rookie,"['Eye Color Hazel', 'Hair color Blonde', 'Skin Tone Medium', 'Skin Type Dry']",4 stars,27 Mar 2020,no,,,,"I like this blush but wouldn’t pay full price for it. I redeemed a Sephora $100 gift card for this and honestly if I had spent money would have returned it. It is a basic matte blush. The top champagne shade has the slightest bit of sheen but I don’t really see it on my cheeks. It is very long lasting which I like most about it. My foundation had faded after 10 hours of wear without primer or setting spray but my blush was still going strong. It’s too hard/inconvenient to put an eyeshadow brush in to try and use the shades individually. Overall it’s nice, it wears well, but the formula or summery coral shade isn’t anything special. I feel like Milani or Colourpop could do the exact same thing for way less $.

blush,NARS,NARS Mosaic Multi-Shade Highlighter & Blush,MBorovinov,Insider,Rookie,"['Eye Color Brown', 'Hair color Black', 'Skin Tone Tan', 'Skin Type Oily']",5 stars,27 Jun 2019,no,,,Stunning!,"This is the first Nars product I’ve ever purchased. It is STUNNING! The blush shade is so beautiful and I think it would work well with many different skintones. I’m med/tan, and it looked like a nice “natural” rosy glow. Even though it’s a powder product, I’ve been using it with a stippling brush, and I really like how it distributes the colors on my cheeks. Since I bought it, it’s pretty much the only cheek product I’ve been using. Definitely follow the instructions and use it with a flat brush to ensure an even distribution of the highlight, blush, and bronzer.

blush,NARS,NARS Mosaic Multi-Shade Highlighter & Blush,s123sa,Rouge,Rookie,"['Eye Color Brown', 'Hair color Brunette', 'Skin Tone Fair', 'Skin Type Combination']",3 stars,9 May 2019,no,,,,"Way too bright for my skin tone, even using a very light hand/fluffy brush to apply. I generally like a bold blush color, but this just looked clownish on me. This might have been because it was both bold and more pink than I usually go for. (for reference—I’m generally the “light” (not ultra “fair”) in concealer/powder, and have yellow undertones.) Gave it 3* as I think it would probably be really pretty on other skin tones, and love the NARS blush packaging + generous size.

I was worried it would be “too much” on my pale, porcelain complexion, but it’s another truly universal shade. There’s a hint on shimmer in the highlighter, but the bronzer and blush are both matte. With the right brush, you can actually use all of them separately, especially the highlight, but they really are better together.

When I swatched this, I knew immediately I had to have it! The combination of the colors is so unique and beautiful. This will be the blush color of summer 2019. My go-to look right now is using all colors as blush, the bronzer on my eyelids and nose contour, and the highlighter on my cheekbones and under eyebrows. Get this NOW since its limited time.

They have gone and made me fall in love again with ""Fireclay"" It's easiest to use if you just swirl your brush over the 3 colors, but you can just use the blush shade for a matte blush, without much worry of getting one of the other colors mixed in. If you want to use the contour or highlighter by itself, you need to use a smaller brush than you're probably used to using to avoid getting the blush color mixed in. This color looks amazing on both very fair and very dark skintones. The color is very buildable; you can go from very subtle to as much drama as you like, so fair skinned gals shouldn't worry the color is too bright.

I use a dense brush and lightly tap into the product. It creates this beautiful, luminous coral hue! The highlighter give the blush a natural golden sheen (with no detectable glitter or shimmer particles). When I wore this blush, everyone kept commenting on how healthy my skin looks, probably because it gives the “I just did a yoga class” type of glow to your cheeks. It lasted through my 16-hour work shift too!
