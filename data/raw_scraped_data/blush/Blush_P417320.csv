Once I’ve washed, applied serum, sunscreen, sometimes primer, then foundation and setting powder, you need something to add back the natural glow you just erased with all those products. I dip a dense, fluffy brush into this product, and use it as a finishing powder. Adds a soft, subtle glow that never looks dry, sparkly, or settles into any texture. It reminds me of what I wanted Hourglass Ambient Powder “Diffused Light” to be...something to add a little radiance without looking as if I tried too hard. I have been pleasantly surprised with the results and will certainly repurchase this highlighter.

It's more of a brightening powder and is great for adding some glimmer to the inner eyes, eyelids, and face in general. Since the formula is more of a powder, it kind of blends in and is very subtle. I would not recommend if you are looking for a highlighter to apply to the cheekbones. I have noticed this product makes me break out a little, so I have stopped using it as frequently, but there's no harm in putting a bit on every once in a while.

It says “nude-pink”, but I’m more tempted to describe it as simply “nude”, because on my light olive skin it really doesn’t have the same pink pigment that regular Dandelion powder has. The highlight to this is so subtle that I often dust it over my entire face like a setting powder if I’m going for a more dewy appearance. In the realm of Benefit highlighters, I would say this is more shimmery than Dandelion ShyBeam but less shimmery than both Watts Up and HighBeam. It also has a lovely, delicate scent like Dandelion...I know that some people dislike that...but I love it. I would recommend this product to anyone looking for a very fine highlighting powder offering a more subtle glow.

It’s something you don’t normally see. The texture is so soft, kind of reminds me of the hourglass bronzers. I would recommend using a setting spray after application because otherwise you might have a powdery finish, and it will wear off within a few hours of wear time. Love it on my fair skin and found it easy to pick and choose whether you want a light natural highlight, or wanted more of a bold highlight. You can do so by spritzing the brush with setting spray for optimal pigment. Buying one for my daughter for her birthday, I know she’ll love it. Well don’t benefit!

It is very soft and natural. It gives a very subtle glow that is suitable for daily wear; e.g. work, day outing. It is definitely not a strong ""popping"" highlight. You can always layer this on though, to achieve a stronger highlight. I did find it a little expensive; however, it is worth it considering the highlight is very natural-looking and suits my skin tone. People think I am fresh and happy- no comments about how ""popping"" my highlighter is. They just think I had a lovely sleep and woke up fresh as a daisy. I'm not sure how this will look on darker skin tones.

That's okay - I don't like blinding highlighters - and this is just another ""natural"" touch when that's my objective. Will probably not buy again, but that's not really a problem, as this little container will last for a very long time!
