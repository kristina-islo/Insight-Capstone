It appeared to be perfect, the exact color I was looking for, and the name had me completely sold. After receiving the blush, a more fitting name would be 'pink honey'. The blush is rosey pink, definitely not the darker deep color in the pictures. Even the swatch on the model doesnt represent to how this really looks in person. Instead of altering the pictures, just make a darker blush! I gave it 2 stars because even though it was too light, it did apply and sit well on my skin. It's sad because during these months, all we can rely on are the pictures and they're unreliable and untrustworthy.

It is very subtle and almost impossible to overdo. I also really like the formula. It does not look powdery on the skin, and it applies evenly and blends beautifully. That being said, I was sadly very disappointed with the color. This should be named ""Honey"", not ""Pink Honey"", as there is little to no pink in this color at all, and it does not look pink on my skin by any stretch of the imagination. Unfortunately, there are no nice light pinks or mauves at all in this collection. The pinks are all either neon bright, or very peachy/brown. I was really hoping this would be a nice, natural light pink, but I was wrong. I wish Clinique would consider coming out with some light pinkish colors for the fair and light skinned girls. I will use this and try layering a light pink over it, but I will not purchase again.

I picked up Pansy Pop when I decided I wanted a lavender toned blush and couldn’t find any other line with one that was just the right colour, and this has turned out to be one of my favourite all time blushes— and that’s saying a lot, as my drawer is full of several Nars, Hourglass, Chanel and Buxom otherwise. I have almost used it up and will definitely buy again. It goes on sheer at first but easily layers without caking on and looking powdery so is flexible to whatever look you’re going for. This Pansy Pop shade is beautiful and fresh looking on my fair olive skin and looks awesome with a similar colour lip. It actually can look really natural with a light hint of bronzer or contour if you are a very fair skinned girl and I don’t know why it’s such a hard shade to find.

The base color is beigeish with a hint of coral or maybe pink. It’s a hint of something. There’s a bit of tiny glitter that doesn’t really add drama. Overall it’s understated yet clearly there. The formula is smooth and color payoff is good. The packaging is pretty awesome. No mirror but light and compact. Easy to know what color it is from a bunch of other blushes in the drawer because of the clear lid.

Lavender is my favorite color and I wasn't sure I could pull off a purple blush but it gives the most beautiful fresh, yet just came in from the cold, flush. It has just enough warmth in it to keep from veering into the unnatural appearance some cool-toned purples can give. For reference, I have strawberry blonde hair, blue-green eyes, and fair skin with a neutral undertone (I'm a perfect match for shade 1N2 Vanilla in Laura Mercier's Flawless Lumiere Radiance foundation). Would look beautiful on warm undertones, as well as slightly cool undertones as it does impart a hint of warmth when applied to the skin. Looks beautiful paired with white gold and peachy/pink highlighters. Applies sheer with one coat but can be easily built up for a much bolder look. Also lasted through a two hour powerlifting training session so I'd say it has some pretty heavy duty lasting power. (;

The formula is buildable which is great since you can control how saturated your cheeks will be. It also looks very natural, in my opinion. For reference, I'm light-medium with cool olive undertones (Asian). Out of all the shades I own, Peach is my favorite. It's brightening on me and has just the right balance of warmth and cool pink. I've always wanted Cola but I don't think it would suit me since it's darker and more pigmented than the ones I own. l noticed that the more saturated blushes with colors more suited for medium to deep skintones are a lot more pigmented than the softer/lighter shades. Even Berry is a little harder for me to control since it can really pack a punch that can clash with my lighter complexion. All in all, I love this blush collection and I like that pigmentation changes depending on the shade. While I am a little bummed out that Cola is too pigmented for me, I can see how someone who's darker than me would like its stronger and more saturated color and pigment.

It’s unbelievable but I have 8 of the shades! My favorites have to be Melon, Fig, Nude, and Peach pop. The formula is non-powdery and blends into the skin so effortlessly. Leaves a healthy sheen without all the sparkles. It naturally brightens up my complexion. It’s sheer, but easily buildable so you don’t have to worry about looking like a clown. The price point and color selection is just great, these are unbeatable!
