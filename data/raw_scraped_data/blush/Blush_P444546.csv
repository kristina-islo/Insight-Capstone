For reference I’m light-medium skin tone (NC30) and this looks so natural and beautiful on the skin. It’s not as bright as it looks in the online pictures and is actually a soft peach color. I have lots of texture on my skin and I found that it doesn’t emphasize texture and last all day for me. It’s highly pigmented so one small tap is the perfect amount for me, but it can built up to be brighter. I highly recommend it!

The colour in the picture is NOT what I got. It looks chalky in person very light not at all coral colour and it’s fairly chalky as well so I’m going to be returning this for sure. I’m medium light to medium skin and it’s not showing up on me. It will probably show up on more fair skin tones. What a shame because I love all of Melt cosmetics other product but this blush was a really big disappointment. 2 big thumbs down

Bawdy is a very cool-toned light pink. On my skin, many of these cool-toned pinks can actually turn a bit warm on my skin because of my oiliness and they end up making my skin look sort of burnt. I find that this blush actually retains the exact color you see when swatched on dry skin. I don't notice any darkening or warming as it wears on my skin throughout the day. I also like layering Melt's Digital Dust in Pink Moon on the cheekbones when I'm in a pink mood. Just a note, this looks a little darker in the pan than how it actually looks applied to the skin. I find that this can look a little chalky on my skin if I apply too much as it really is that cool-toned. For reference, my closest color matches are the Fenty Pro Filt'r Soft Matte foundation in 290 and the Cover FX Power Play concealer in G Medium 2.

For those of us who have warm-toned skin and want a very natural looking blush shade, when pinks just look obvious, this is a great option. I would describe it was a warm nude shade. I would not reach for this when I want peachy cheeks, but I absolutely would grab it when I want a ""no makeup"" look with my light, warm olive skin. The powder blends nicely and I haven't noticed any fallout that others mention - I use a flat paddle brush for blush, so that may make a difference.

It’s extremely powdery, there’s so much fallout, it’s insane, this will be panned in months because of it. It blends away on my face, has no staying power, even over stick blushes. I have to reapply it 3-4 times and if I add a finishing powder over it, forget it, it’s over. I usually end up adding another blush on top. I’m super disappointed, I wanted to love it so bad.

blush,MELT COSMETICS,Melt Cosmetics Blush,HazelLaBeija,Rouge,Rookie,"['Eye Color Hazel', 'Hair color Brunette', 'Skin Tone Porcelain', 'Skin Type Combination']",5 stars,5 Aug 2019,no,Color: Cali Dream,https://www.sephora.com/productimages/sku/s2229573+sw.jpg,If I could only have one blush it'd be this...,"Let me start off by saying that I've only owned this blush for two days and it's already become an absolute staple in my collection. It's been surprisingly hard to find an orange blush that's not too pink or peachy, but they totally nailed the pigment on this shade for that vibrant but natural summery flush. It's a lovely tangerine shade, I'd hesitate to call it coral because usually corals in cosmetics have a lot of pink or red in them and this one doesn't. I agree with other reviewers that if you go into this powder aggressively with a dense brush you will get quite a bit of kick-up, but I find that going in with a tapered fluffy blush brush with a light hand does just the trick. You only need to tap your brush in the product once but it goes on smoothly, evenly, and doesn't show up patchy or cakey at all on the skin. This did not make my dry cheeks look textured and gross like most powders do, and even smooths the texture a bit, so if you have texture and dry skin like me don't be afraid to give these a try. These are definitely on the opposite side of the spectrum from something like the Hourglass blushes (lots of glow, minimal pigment), as in the Melt ones are incredibly pigmented with a light hand and don't impart an actual shimmer or glow, but rather a natural radiance due to the vibrancy of the pigment. As someone who enjoys bold blush looks, this looked gorgeous on my pale skin, but I think it would be even more of a natural everyday shade on darker skin tones. If you're pale and want a no blush kind of blush look maybe try Honey Thief. Another plus is that these blushes have an incredible wear time. After 6 hours of wear, my blush was just as pigmented as when I put it on that morning. Whenever I caught a glimpse of my makeup in the mirror I just was amazed by the fresh and bright look it created. For a collector of blushes, this blush definitely stands out in my collection and is well worth the money.

Seriously, one dip is all you need. One super tiny tap, that's it! I'm serious! They blend so well and they show up as such a beautiful color!!! The Cali Dream is such a perfect blend of nude, coral, and peach to really give a natural looking blush on your face! This blush is going to last an extremely long time with everyday use because it takes so little to get the perfect look. I'm in love with this color! I love how the formulation doesn't have any shimmer or glitter to it like most peachy-coral blushes do. The packaging is safe to be thrown into your purse with no problem. I highly suggest giving this blush a try!
