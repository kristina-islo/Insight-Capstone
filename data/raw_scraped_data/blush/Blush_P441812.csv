blush,NARS,NARS Exposed Cheek Palette,angiemarie1960,Insider,Rookie,"['Eye Color Brown', 'Hair color Black', 'Skin Tone Medium', 'Skin Type Combination']",4 stars,6 d ago,no,,,beautiful luminous blushes,I don’t see what everyone’s problem is with this palette?! The blushes swatch perfectly fine and apply beautifully with a brush or a sponge!! There are five different shades of blush which are all quite lovely and different from each other. I love mine! The highlighter is too glittery for me that’s the only thing I don’t love about this NARS palette but it makes a lovely eyeshadow especially with a damp brush.,0,0,Recommends this product
blush,NARS,NARS Exposed Cheek Palette,tinestr,VIB,Rookie,"['Age over 54', 'Eye Color Blue', 'Hair color Brunette', 'Skin Tone Fair', 'Skin Type Combination']",4 stars,6 d ago,no,,,PERFECT FOR FAIR SKIN,"The product description clearly states that the colours are lightweight and it is more of a sheer pigment, so I do not understand the reviews dragging this palette because of the lack of pigment. The palette is beautiful, perfect to create a natural look. I have a fair skin and these are one of those rare blushes that do not make me look like a clown with one swatch. I recommend this to anyone who has fair skin or prefers to build up the colour. I also love using this as a base before applying a more pigmented blush.

I've been wanting a NARS blush palette forever and finally made the splurge and got this one because their individual blushes are so damn good. But there is no color pay off.

It’s actually great and the packaging is sooo pretty. Yes it’s a different formula from the classic nars single blushes but that doesn’t make it bad. Using a nice large stippling brush I had to swirl it around a couple times to get it going at first to pick up the product but now it applies just as smoothly as my other nars blushes, less powdery with this smoother formula and giving a nice wash of color across the cheeks. I saw this palette last spring when it came out and passed up on it over two vib sales but finally gave in this past sale. I am a nars blush lover so maybe I’m biased but this pretty palette def deserves better reviews. It’s just as great inside as it’s pretty on the outside!

blush,NARS,NARS Exposed Cheek Palette,sarianne,Rouge,Rookie,"['Eye Color Blue', 'Hair color Red', 'Skin Tone Porcelain', 'Skin Type Dry']",5 stars,21 Nov 2019,yes,,,Best NARS Blush Palette Yet!,"Oh my goodness, I can't believe I waited so long to get this palette! I have so many of the limited edition NARS blush palettes and love them all, but got to a point where I felt that I probably had enough blush. After waffling on this particular palette since it was released, I finally broke down and bought it- and I love it. I am very fair, so take this with a grain of salt, but even so, these blushes can be built up to be very pigmented, and I have to use a light hand to not deposit too much color. I use a slightly stiffer, small blush brush since this is a harder-pressed product, and it picks up plenty of pigment without needing to use the product wet. What I love about this formula is that it looks incredibly natural. The texture is perfectly skin-like; it's a luminous satin finish with no shimmer (except in the highlight shade) that just melts into the skin. If you're contemplating this palette, I'd encourage you to give it a chance, even if you're unfamiliar with this particular blush formula. The shades may not suit every skin tone equally well, but I do not believe this palette suffers from a lack of pigment. If you have it and wish it were more pigmented, try using a slightly stiffer brush (or a damp brush, as the product description suggests for more opaque coverage).

The highlight is also not very blingy, which is also fine for a chiller look. It’s just not 5 stars for me. Not repurchasing. Been using this for months at this point btw.

I swatched it and it was beautiful. Using a brush, on the other hand, is another story. With my pallet, I have to swirl and rub and basically dig the powder out to get any pigmentation. I’ve resigned myself to running my brush, back and forth no less than 20 times, over all 3 of the bottom colors to get any really payoff. I’m going to keep using it because the blend of colors does look nice and I threw away the box so returning it isn’t possible. I won’t be buying it again.

Formula is neat, similar to a cream-to-powder (but easy on the cream). Only 'issue' is that as a brown-er person, there are more 'highlight' colors than blush for me, but wear and color pay off are good. 2-3 blushes and 3 highlighters make it a great deal.

I've been a huge fan of their products for years now, so to encounter such a massive dud was surprising! Like the other reviewers mentioned - you have to SCRUB your brush into the pan to even pick up any color. The color that my brushes picked up would be apply ""streakily"" onto my face. I get that they are trying to adopt a ""creamy"" formula, but the issue with that is that textures may not play well with skin that already has foundation and powder layered on. Applying the blush wet wasn't a winner either - I ended up with clown cheeks! Ultimately, this was one of the first NARS products I have ever returned. I just couldn't find a practical use for it, and applying it was way more work than it was worth. Gorgeous packaging and design, but the formula was a big no-no from me.

blush,NARS,NARS Exposed Cheek Palette,Urielle,Rouge,Rookie,"['Eye Color Hazel', 'Hair color Blonde', 'Skin Tone Porcelain', 'Skin Type Combination']",5 stars,24 May 2019,no,,,Glowy Blushes- Sturdy Packaging- Versatile,"This is a great palette. The packaging is incredibly sturdy and feels very lux. Girls with nails beware- the clasp is hard to open. I actually like that, because I know it won't ever stop closing by being losing integrity. This is a ""gelée"" formula. There isn't any fallout. You need a stiffer brush to use at first. They get easier to pick up after a couple of uses. The colors are amazing. Every blush color has a sheen to them, but are not metallic. They do not have glitter or sparkles. *Swatches were not built up* Top row- Left to right: The highlight is a pinky champagne. It has micro glitter in it that is incredibly fine. Can be subdued or more impactful. 2nd color is a light orange blush that leans coral. 3rd shade is a burnt organgey brown shade. Can be used alone as a blush bronzer or with the 2nd shade in this row. 2nd row- left to right: 1st shade is a true coral shade. 2nd color is a medium pink shade. The 3rd shade is a dark pink- magenta shade. I am 120 in fenty, Nars Mont Blanc, Laura mercier cameo, Hourglass stick in cream, Tarte fair beige. All of these shades work for me. I think this palette can work on a variety of different skin tones because the formula is buildable. I'm not sure about the highlight on the deepest skin, but I think most of the other shade will work very well.

Ignore the reviews that say there is little pigmentation. I’m NW45 in MAC/410 in Fenty and these blushes show on me with just a minimal amount on the brush. Obviously, the two lightest colors I could use as contours. However, the other 4 are great blush colors. My favorite so far is Give It Away. It’s the best neutral/natural/subtle cheek color for me. I could wear this practically every day. This color and Nars’ Taos are my favorite blushes. Pick up this limited edition before it’s gone.

blush,NARS,NARS Exposed Cheek Palette,SFRugrat,Rouge,Rookie,"['Eye Color Green', 'Hair color Blonde', 'Skin Tone Medium', 'Skin Type Combination']",5 stars,29 Mar 2019,no,,,"Absolutely, Positively, The Best Blush Palette","Con’s: This Palette might not show up too vividly on deeper skin tones (Hoping they come out with a dark version, I will still purchase that too). Pro’s: Let’s just get packaging out of the way, Nars is the master for makeup packaging, it’s breathtaking and makes doing makeup so much fun, especially if you love blush, reaching for this every morning is going to be a must. Now to the important stuff, this is the best blush palette I’ve ever purchased and typically I’m against splurging on Nars. Some people are obsessed with brows, lips, eyeshadow, highlight... I’m obsessed with blush. I’ve purchased from nearly every brand, and have yet to be fully satisfied. I have textured cheeks (I am a boy - part time, and shave constantly) so my pores are deep, and typically blushes will become patchy when applied or highlight my texture... not this blush formula. The formula is s-t-u-n-n-i-n-g. I don’t know how, but it blurs my pores. You cannot see my pores at all once the blush is applied. The colors are so beautiful on the cheeks, I cannot stress that enough. The formula is buildable, blendable, beautiful, natural, blissful. The highlighter is surprisingly gorgeous, doesn’t grab or expose texture, it’s blinding with one swipe, has shimmer particles much like the Fenty highlighters but is less texture grabby. In summary, do not feel guilty for throwing down $60 on this palette, if you’re tired of your current blush stash, have been trying lackluster blushes, look no further. This is my favorite blush palette I’ve ever purchased and I do not say that lightly, I’ve spent hundreds on blushes and have only had a few tried and true. This palette and formula blows everything else out of the water.
