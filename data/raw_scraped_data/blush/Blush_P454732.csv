My only issue is it lacks staying power but I am comparing it to Tom Ford and Natasha Denona, my daily drivers. I normally do not need to reapply blush but with Kat Von D I did see a noticeable fading through the day.

It's lightweight so it feels a bit cheap but to be honest it doesn't bother me at all. It says to ""kiss"" the blush with your brush because it's pigmented - IT IS NOT LYING. You can quite easily go overboard. Now if that's your vibe, rock it. The foxglove shade is defined as a dusty rose which is one of my absolute favourite blush colours. It's a natural flush of colour which suits many skin tones (I'm fair/light with freckles). It will last you a very long time because of the strong pigmentation. Beware there is a lot of kickback in the pan. I will be rocking this a lot!

Now I literally only barely touch the blush and can get a huge amount of color payoff on my cheeks. This will surely last a lifetime.
