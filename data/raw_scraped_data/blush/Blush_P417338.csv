blush,NATASHA DENONA,Natasha Denona Blush Duo,jacey2,Rouge,Rookie,"['Eye Color Blue', 'Hair color Brunette', 'Skin Tone Fair', 'Skin Type Dry']",5 stars,9 Nov 2019,no,Color: 04 Pink,https://www.sephora.com/productimages/sku/s1909647+sw.jpg,,"There are two very pretty blushes with a lovely light scent and color with staying power in this blush duo palette #04. I like this blush duo so much that I hit pan & repurchased it. The packaging is attractive, has a nice weight & feels good in my hand. It is secured with a magnetic closure. I have a light complexion with a neutral undertone & love pink, but have to be careful with this color or it may look too babyish on me having the paradoxical effect of making me look older than I am & who wants that once you are of legal age? These two colors, 18 Renee’s pastel pink & 19 pink, each have enough pigment that they can be worn separately, they also blend together nicely. 19 Pink has just the right amount of shimmer; enough to add interest, but not so much that it will draw undue attention to any fine lines. I also have Blush Duo palette #9 with 02 toutou & #04 matte peachy nude. The pigment, ability to blend & scent are the same as the other duo, however the darker color is not quite right for my particular skin tone. I still give the blushes five stars as I don’t expect every color to be right for me and I would try more of the duos.

The next morning during my beauty routine it came time for blush, I automatically grabbed this duo in anticipation. Boy was I let down. I dipped a clean brush in and no pigment, so I swirled my brush around and around and there still was no color payoff. I even tried 2 different brushes. Unfortunately this baby made its way back to Sephora.

I love the packaging, performance, and quality of this blush. I think the problem with many people who buy Natasha's products is that they do not investigate how to use them. The lighter blush is the foundation to which you put the ""colored"" blush on top of. Natasha has a You Tube channel where she teaches how to use all her products (separately and together.) She has a certain aesthetic and her products are not meant to look harsh but rather highlight your natural beauty and enhance it. If you are interested in a powerful color payoff--these blushes may not be for you. If you are interested in a glow from within/ how does she do it look--then buy this blush.

blush,NATASHA DENONA,Natasha Denona Blush Duo,quasiluna,,,[],1 star,1 Apr 2017,no,,,I tried,"I bought ""Sheer Nude"" and have to say that it's very dusty and not pigmented. Also, while the deeper shade is okay, the lighter ""Tou Tou"" shade that makes up 50% of the compact is so completely yellow. It makes me look sallow, like my cheeks have an unappealing wash of matte gold/apricot stamped on top. Weirdly enough, it's especially evident how unnatural it looks in dim lighting. Are you supposed to mix the shades? Use as a highlighter? Either way, it's a really unflattering look. It's a shame that almost all the other blush duos have this exact same yellow pan of color in the compact. I might be tempted to try another duo, but I won't because it just annoys me that they've lazily decided to add this horrific shade to nearly all the blushes. One star for cool packaging. Pass.
