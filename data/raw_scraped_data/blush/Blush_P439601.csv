I find pink and red blush to be overwhelming on me but this blush definitely works for me and matches my skin tone. It goes well with my fenty foundation and laura mercier powder. I have oily skin so it tends to come off throughout the day but if I use setting spray it stays on longer. I like the fact that theres two colors, i take a swipe at both instead of using each side individually. This will be my go to blush for now on.
