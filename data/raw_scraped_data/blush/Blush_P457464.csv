The color is cute but if you blend too much the color goes away into nothing and I think it’s really Dewy until it dries. I wear a full coverage foundation and this moved my make up off and didn’t layer well. I think if you wore it on its own it could be nice, but not if you wear foundation.",0,0,

It just slides around, doesn't settle in (and I'm not even greasy right now); after a while my cheeks just look blotchy. For dry skin I would definitely recommend it, because the peachy Papaya tint has a great girly natural looking flush color, nice texture, and smells like bubble gum. Taking off 1 star ONLY because the product description did not mention that this is geared towards dry skin type.
