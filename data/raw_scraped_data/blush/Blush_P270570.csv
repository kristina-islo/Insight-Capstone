I'm my 40s so I certainly don't need all kinds of shimmer to accentuate my fine lines. I appreciate that she has two types, for matte and shimmer based on the look you're trying to achieve. I bought this tiny product based on an employee's recommendation worried it was too little product and the color might be too bright. I wouldn't hesitate a moment if I were you... it lasts forever because it is very pigmented and the color is just spot on noticeable flush. It's actually ""shortened"" my morning routine because I'm now comfortable with the pigment and simply dip my brush and it's always perfect on both sides in less than a minute. I don't know about you, but I'd prefer that over layering to get the desired color. I've received many compliments over the years, also probably because my skin is so fair it's nearly clear, but be that what it may I have been using it faithfully for what feels like a decade. If you're hesitant due to the price vs. size, it's a non-issue. It lasts longer than any other blush I've had. Bobbi is indeed brilliant.

I purposefully went in determined to buy this blush no matter what it looked like in the packaging because I've read such great reviews.

First impression when seeing it in the packaging was WOW, that is some really bright pink blush!! I bought it anyway and was not disappointed. Like I said, as soon as I got in the car I applied it and was not disappointed one bit. This is my favorite blush I've ever tried. I do have NARS Orgasm and plan to still wear it for days when I'm just running errands. It doesn't go on flashing PINK, but really pretty. I know it's more pricy than most, but I suggest at least swatching it if you can so you can see how beautiful the color is before you say, ""No,"" because it's so bright in the packaging.

blush,BOBBI BROWN,Bobbi Brown Blush,llvd,,,[],5 stars,6 May 2017,no,,,Pale Pink - deceptively natural,"I learned about pale pink from Michelle Money's YouTube, and despite being a makeup lover I am much more comfortable with a natural, I-woke-up-like-this, tanned kind of Jennifer Aniston, Gisele Bundchen look. The blue based pink gives my face a juicy, alive look, not a powdery, made-up one. I use a light hand no matter what product I use, and this blush has been the only one with any kind of punch. I range from NC25 to slightly darker when I self-tan, and it looks equally natural whether I'm pale or tan.

If we're being completely honest I picked this one over the others because it's the blush that Catherine Duchess of Cambridge wore for her wedding day and her cheeks looked positively ravishing. To look at the blush in the packaging it looks VERY pink and an unnatural pink at that. However, I gave it the benefit of the doubt and tried it. This colour is exquisite, it perfectly mimics the colour my cheeks turn when I'm flushed or if they've been freshly pinched. It is very pigmented but blends with minimal effort as long as you have a nice fluffy brush. I've only had it on for about 5 hours at this point but it looks the exact same as when I put it on. This colour is very well suited for my fair skin but I could also see it working on other skin tones as well. I hope this is helpful to the other ladies (and gents) out there checking out Bobbi Brown!

blush,BOBBI BROWN,Bobbi Brown Blush,katiemcc93,,,"['Age 18-24', 'Skin Type Dry', 'Skin Tone Light', 'Eye Color Hazel']",5 stars,31 Mar 2017,no,,,Nectar,"Grabbed this from a CCO a few years ago, and it's my go-to. Super natural on my skin whether it's Winter and I'm fair, or Summer and I'm about 5 shades darker. I find it lasts longer than a lot of blushes I use and I think the application is super easy. If you're familiar with the consistency of Tarte blushes (which I also like), this is a bit of a softer consistency, so I find it a little easier to work with! Highly recommend for something easy that you don't have to really work with to make it look beautiful.

It's unbelievably pigmented though so I literally can only dab the powder and then knock off the excess with a fluffy blush brush. It gives the most beautiful coral flush to the skin. The color isn't even listed anymore it seems but if anyone women of color can get their hands on this shade I beg you not to hesitate.

Now, I have a few ""good"" blushes...from Laura Mercier, Nars...but this BB blush. Holy Pigment, Batman! Which is good, a little goes a LOOOONG way. But I wish I'd known that before I did my usual, dip/tap/apply. You only need to barely touch the tinies tip of your brush into this blush to have plenty of pigment for your cheeks. Now that that's covered, the color is pretty and what it claims to be...a warm pink. It's pretty matte and is flattering on my fair, neutral to warm skin. Sure, it costs more and has less product, but it's ok because you don't need much product to get the desired effect...pretty pink cheeks. Definitely recommend. Give it a try.

I was nervous buying this one at first because of the color, but once I took it home and used my brush I was really pleased. It's highly pigmented, so a little goes a long way. I use a light hand, and its a nice color for my skin (Hispanic, light brown skin). It can easily be built up if needed. It seems like it will last a long time and the quality is great!
