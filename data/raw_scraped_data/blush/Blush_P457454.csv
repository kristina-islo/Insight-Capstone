blush,LUNAR BEAUTY,Lunar Beauty Moon Prism Blush Palette,allison89xx,VIB,Rookie,"['Eye Color Green', 'Hair color Brunette', 'Skin Tone Light', 'Skin Type Combination']",5 stars,3 d ago,no,,,P E R F E C T,"Just received this the other day & I absolutely love it! Obviously the packaging is stunning and the mirror inside is very nice too. The mirror seems to be more clear and of higher quality but anyway, I love all the shades. And they all perform beautifully. I have a light neutral complexion so the 2 darker shades (spacey & gravity) don’t work for me as blushes but ‘gravity’ works as a bronzer on me & I used ‘spacey’ as a light wash of eyeshadow and I lived the way it turned out! I can see myself using up all these shades in the future. So happy I found a great blush palette that I can use as a complete everyday palette! Just the right amount of pigmentation, there’s a small amount of kick up in the pan but nothing crazy. Highly recommend :)

The colors are amazing on my skin and formula is easy to blend, not overly pigmented but buildable. The color lasts all day and I just love them! Also- cherry on top is the packaging!

blush,LUNAR BEAUTY,Lunar Beauty Moon Prism Blush Palette,Yoriel,Rouge,Rookie,"['Eye Color Brown', 'Hair color Brunette', 'Skin Tone Medium', 'Skin Type Dry']",4 stars,5 d ago,no,,,"Hello, Pigment!","Beautiful palette! Five shades are matte and the one luminous shade can be mixed with the others to create even more variety. The blushes are PIGMENTED TO THE MAX! You only need to go in with the lightest hand and a lot of product easily picks up on a brush. There is a lot of versatility here, and the color range is very inclusive. Bonus points for stunning packaging. I uploaded a detailed review to my channel (search PersonalBeautyLab on YouTube) if you want to see it in action with swatches, etc. Definitely recommend! In the photo, I’m wearing the first two shades mixed.

I instantly fell in love, the formula and the shades are so unique and that’s hard to say with a powder blush! I might have to declutter every single one of my powder blushes because I will probably start using this EVERY. SINGLE. DAY. Get it, you seriously won’t regret it! It is perfect for summer and even got the deep shades for those fall/winter months!",8,4,Recommends this product
blush,LUNAR BEAUTY,Lunar Beauty Moon Prism Blush Palette,juliaem,Rouge,Rookie,"['Eye Color Brown', 'Hair color Blonde', 'Skin Tone Medium', 'Skin Type Combination']",1 star,6 d ago,yes,,,dull dry chalky steaky mess,"Packaging is A++ truly is stunning, the moons look 3D. However the product is sooo dry and far too pigmented which makes it impossible to apply and blend out correctly. Turns into a streaky ugly mess. The colours apply WAY darker than they look in the pan, not the cute light spring shades you're expecting. Im disappointed because I love blush and really wanted to support Manny but this is not for me. Recommend Tarte blushes if you're wanting a beautiful matte pink/peach shade that lasts all day.

Should have gave us all singles!,Not for darker skinned people! all of these shades are too light for people who are darker skinned. if your darker then MAC NC45 or Fenty 160 this product will be useless for you! dont waste your money. Also its 2020...why come out with blush palette? just give us singles so we can pick which ones we want and which ones we don't.,15,22,

HE KILLED THIS. I bought mine seconds into launch day directly from Lunars site. The colors work for so many skin colors AND looks. I cannot rave about them enough. The Fact that he made a single shimmer shade just for those shimmer lovers, is pure thought for the wearers. LOVE IT",6,2,Recommends this product
