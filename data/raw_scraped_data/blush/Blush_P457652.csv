blush,NATASHA DENONA,Natasha Denona Mini Bloom Blush,EmilyAman,VIB,Rookie,"['Eye Color Green', 'Hair color Blonde', 'Skin Tone Fair', 'Skin Type Dry']",4 stars,9 d ago,yes,,,Broken in packaging but works great,"The only reason that I wont rate this product 5 stars is that the entire pan fell out and broke the first time I used it. However, that being said the color pay off was really pretty. I am very fair skinned and it showed up as a peachy orangey pinky color. If you like a bright highlight, you're still going to want to buy a straight highlighter. This is not super illuminating but it does give off a really light pink highlight on top. You will definitely over do it on the blush before you ever get the highlight your looking for to accompany your blush. But this would work really well for a natural look. I tried to pack the broken pieces back in but i ended up just breaking it up in to powder and used it that way. The formula itself is actually really nice went on in only a couple passes and was not translucent. Im not sure how well this would show up on darker skin tones though, but i think you'd still get the sheen from the highlighting to show up and would look really pretty. Recommend.

blush,NATASHA DENONA,Natasha Denona Mini Bloom Blush,CrisciAnaaa,VIB,Rookie,"['Hair Condition Coarse', 'Eye Color Brown', 'Hair color Brunette', 'Skin Tone Dark', 'Skin Type Oily']",5 stars,18 d ago,no,,,Amazing for Textured and/or Dark skin,"Dark skin people who always wanted a Nars Orgasm blush to work on their skin tone... this is it!!! It shows up as a peachy pink and it’s super glowy and pretty Textured skin people looking for a glowy blush!! This is it!! She changed the formula and made this super skin and not texture enhancing! It’s not metallic or glittery.. it’s just a smooth glowy shiny look. Doesn’t emphasize like a highlighter or have reflect.. it’s more of just a shiny glow in powder form. My acne and pores don’t get gross and emphasize when I layer this powder on. It’s that new powder technology. Amazing and worth it. I actually live the small size. Perfect to travel but still lacks a mean punch

blush,NATASHA DENONA,Natasha Denona Mini Bloom Blush,Sable60,Rouge,Rookie,"['Eye Color Brown', 'Hair color Brunette', 'Skin Tone Medium', 'Skin Type Dry']",5 stars,3 May 2020,yes,,,"Yes, For Natasha Denona Mini Bloom Blush","Im ALL ABOUT Natasha Denona cosmetics! Ive collected the items that suit my skin tone. Im light/medium. Dont fear this Bright coral shade or the word ""highlighter"" This is a shmmery blush. No glitter bomb! Im pretty sure, even fair skin to the darkest tones, could use this Bloom Blush shade. I use a stippling brush to apply then blend out edges with my beauty blender. The pigment is long lasting & wont fade thru the day. The mini size, is actually a generous amount to play with and should last for quite some time. The formula isnt dry or dusty. Not patchy either. Like I stated, a good stippling brush will place the pigment where you want it then use your beauty blender to blend any harsh edges. I also used a dense, paddle shaped brush and got good results too. This shade is going to be a nice Spring/Summer blush shade. My 1st photo is with flash. 2nd photo, without flash.

It's absolutely gorgeous and brings cheek to life with such a perfect natural color, luminosity and beautiful healthy glow that I haven't found yet in another blush. I have to precise that it's actually my first ND blush though. I had only some eye and face palettes from her in my collection so I can't compare this blush with any others from her line to be honest. That being said, I only use high end products. I have tried almost every top brands on Sephora and other stores and because of that, I think I can pretty much give a good opinion on this product. My favorite makeup brands at Sephora are Hourglass, ND, Armani, Marc Jacob, Nars, ABH, HB, UD, TF and Lancôme. Of course, I have my OG in each brand because none of them has only OG products. Some are awesome, some are bad. I've also ordered the bloom face palette from her so can't wait to finally try it after all the awesome reviews I've read on it. I'll be able to compare this blush with the others in the palette I'm waiting for. But for now, I just can't say enough good things about it. I would give this 10 out of 5 if I could. Worth every penny. Trust me! So happy I got my hands on it. I will repurchase for sure and I plan on trying more products from pretty soon. Totally recommend!

Sadly it arrived shattered, but Sephora sent me a replacement. I did push together the shattered one, and it's a fluffy gel-like texture, that kind of moussed back into shape, if that makes sense. It's the kind of texture that probably won't last forever like other powders, more gel-like almost. Anyways, it's sheer, moderately bright, coral, and you can layer it for more pigment.

The texture is incredibly silky and while the blush is pigmented beautifully, it's also very buildable. One layer of blush is very much like a tinted highlighter, but three layers and you have a GORGEOUS baby pink blush with beautiful glimmer in it. Great quality and quantity for the price, especially for a Natasha Denona product, and it comes in an adorable and partially holographic TIN compact!!! If you like NARS' Super Orgasm blush, this is a GREAT dupe with better shimmer!
