If you put it over foundation or without it, i it just doesn’t seem to last for some reason. Other than that, it smells good, looks good on the skin, and is easy to blend. It’s not too sheer but looks naturally pretty radiant. I love this product and I recommend it to anyone who wants to achieve a no makeup- makeup look! If you’re going for full glam, maybe this isn’t for you (or any cream blushes for that matter) but if this is for an everyday, glowey, glossier esk look, have at it! My favorite shades are 06 and 03. They both compliment my medium skin w/ neutral undertone skin tone. Great price too, most cream blushes are expensive. One thing I mike that I thought I’d hate is the application! The spongy applicator is so easy to use and really good for pictures. Other than the lasting issue, I will definitely incorporate this into my bag!

You'll need to be rested. Drink a glass of water beforehand to be hydrated. Apply your primer, foundation and concealer as usual. DON'T POWDER YOUR FACE YET!!! Now you're ready to apply your blush. DON'T USE THE STAMP! I know it's cute and you want to, but don't. It's a trap. The blush will dry too fast and you will be stuck with weird spots on your face. You don't want that. Use your finger and gently press the cushion. Now, gently tap your fingers where you want to apply the blush. DON'T RUB IT! You'll ruin your base. You can layer it as much as you want. It really blends well with fingers. I didn't have much success with brushes/sponges. Now that you've finished your blush application, you're free to continue your makeup as you wish. You can put powder on top of it, but is has a really beautiful finish when left by itself. It lasts a very decent amount of time too.
