I used to own the shade Dollface, and when I ran out I purchased Glisten. Both are really beautiful on my fair skin, and I love that some shades have shimmer and some don’t. My only complaint is that the lid/top broke off from the base on both of my compacts, which is kind of annoying. In terms of color, you can probably find similar ones elsewhere. But—nothing else is going to have the same staying-power.

It is matte but extremely blendable, applies on skin softly and beautifully, and it never breaks me out. I use it over Tatre’s Amazonian Clay sheer setting powder. Love love love the combo.

The pan is quite hard and it doesn’t swatch well, but when applied to the face it gives a very soft look. If you want a blush that’s easy to build up without the fear of applying too much colour, this might be the product for you. Since it’s so subtle, it would be really hard to apply too much. So if you’re looking for strong colour pay off and pigment, you probably won’t like this formula.

I love the 12hr wear, which meant it would stay put after a long day at work. Unfortunately, this blush just didn't do it for me. It has no pigmentation and i had to really press down hard with the brush to get any pigment off and on to my cheek. I thought my blush was defective, asked for a new one (Tarte has excellent customer service, as does Sephora). Got a new blush and same issue. Maybe it's the color, but i can't see any color on my fingers when i press on the blush, or on my brush or cheeks. It was hugely disappointing. I have used NARS for years and wanted to try a new blush and this just didn't do it for me. I love other Tarte products though, but recommend to skip this one.

The hunt for a blush I truly love has been difficult. I wanted something that gave me a barely flushed look. This nude pink color is perfect. It doesn't look overdone or unnatural. It's a lovely wash of color. It's been relatively long lasting. I definitely still notice color at the end of my work day. Highly recommend,0,0,Recommends this product
