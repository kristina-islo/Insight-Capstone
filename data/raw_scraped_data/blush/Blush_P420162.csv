I apply it lower on the cheek than I normally do for blush (almost like a contour) and I think it's quite a soft way to sculpt cheeks. It does have some pink to it, so it cannot be used as an all over contour, but it does help offer a bit of a healthy glow without being in your face bright pink. The pink and coral are pretty as well, and make it great for travel, but my obsession is definitely with Kash.

I love the colors in this trio for my fair skin but my only complaint would be the middle shade is packed with gold glitter. I am not a fan of glittery blushes so I don’t foresee myself getting as much use out of the middle shade, which is unfortunate because it is a beautiful pop of pink. (I put a close up picture of the blushes to show the glitter in the middle shade) My go to has been the far right “Kash” but I also love the neutral mauve tone of “Blank” - they are also really nice mixed together! These blushes are pigmented and they do build nicely. When I wear “Kash” I notice there’s a really nice glow to my cheeks. I noticed a lot of people complaining about the pan size and yes, they are a little narrow so you do have to be really careful with how you angle your brush in the pan in order to only get the color you want.. but I wouldn’t consider that a deal breaker because I personally love the size for both travel and keeping in my purse. Also, the mirror in the compact is a nice bonus. Aside from travel, I also commute by train during the week and sometimes have to finish or touch up my face makeup - this mirror is perfect for that!

Rose is beautiful, but I'm disappointed that my money only got me one usable color. If you need a bright, pigmented set, this may be the palette for you. Otherwise, pick a different set of colors.

I have fair skin with cool undertones and dark hair and I find every shade in the Pool Party palette to be very wearable. Its my ideal palette, with a beige shade for bronzing and a pink and a peach shade. All of the shades are matte. The pink is supposed to be ""matte with gold sparkles"" but I don't see the sparkles at all when I apply it to my skin. This is very pigmented, so use a light touch to avoid over doing it and the palette will last a long time. Some reviewers have commented that the pans are too small or narrow, but I think the size is idea for travel. I use the Sigma blush brush and it fits nicely swiping up and down the pan. I like this so much I intend to buy the Pink Passion palette so I can try the satin finishes.

Although they’re pigmented, they aren’t going to make your cheeks look crazy, because the colors are so natural and beautiful it just looks like your cheeks are very flushed. The only blushes that I think would be a dupe for this is the warm blush palette from Morphe that has peaches and corals, but Morphe’s is so pigmented that it looks bad quicker. I also love that these blushes make my pores vanish, don’t emphasize texture WHATSOEVER, and my cheeks just look so dang pretty after applying. I’ve never found a blush that minimizes pores, typically they bring them out either with the color or formula, but not with these blushes. Will be buying more!

I found this for a really good price at TJ Maxx, and I feel like it was worth that price, but I wouldn't recommend getting this at the full $30 retail price as I don't think it's worth that much. I have this trio in the shade Peachy Love and I love all 3 colors, but be aware that the middle color is matte but the two outside colors both have a little shimmer/glitter in them. It's not very noticeable when applied to the face, but if you hate non-matte blushes, you might want to avoid this.

The glitter is micro fine so it doesn’t look like you’re wearing kids’ play makeup or anything, but gives it a bit of dimension to your cheeks. It wears for a full day on me.

Since I’m An Older Gal Building The Color Up I’m In Favor Of A More Subtle Approach ❋ It Looks Really Attractive On In That Manner For Me. It’s Rich In Pigmentation ❋ Excess Dust Is Not A Factor For This Particular Palette ❋ The Finished Result Is A Blush Success ❋ I Will Definitely Buy This Again ❋

It's been awhile since I purchased a blush palette and all the colors worked on me. I'm like caramel going on mocha and I love each color on me. I'm not a diehard blush collector and wanted a palette with more than one color I could travel with, and this is perfect. But for those who use it - a little goes a long way. Definitely start with a little and build up. This will last you awhile. Very happy with my purchase. Heck yes I'd recommend, you can't go wrong with one of these ABH blush trios. Find one that works with your skin tone and buy it!
