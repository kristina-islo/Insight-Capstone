I got the shade Bare which was actually a more coral/warm-bright color than a neutral/berry. It lasts nicely on the skin, is not too dewy or sticky, and doesn’t appear to disturb your base even when dabbed directly on the skin. It’s an okay product but I think there are better options out there.

The illuminator is great too- seamless and easy-to-use. I shy away from contouring and just stick with basic bronzer in the zones, so this tool helps accentuate the top of the check bone and right under the eyebrow. Would highly recommend. I'm very satisfied and it stays on all day from my experience!

This tells you how easy is to apply. I just dab with my fingers and apply, it blends beautifully and it looks like a natural flush and glow from within. Two caviats: 1. The packaging is gorgeus but if you want it to be kept intact, I suggest using a little fabric bag or something because it get's scratched pretty quickly. Mine is all busted out because once I discovered this it was too late. :( 2. It's not a long wear product, it will need reaplication, but it's so beautiful that I think it's worth it. I would say it stays put for about 2 or 3 hours.

When twisted all the way up, it is around half of an inch... mayyybe 3/4 of an inch, if I’m being generous. So yes, the product itself is amazing. The amount you get for the price?

I returned the rose coral, as the color seemed very orange/terra cotta on my skin. The pink is ok, but I have other pink blushes I like better. But the Bare....wow! This is a beautiful, beautiful pink nude with just enough color that I don't look washed out. For me, it's also the only one that I can truly use on cheeks, lips and eyes and the look is natural but very polished. So far I'm finding it lasting very well, even as lip color. Also, the Bare color seems to blend more easily than the pink, which feels very waxy to me. Not sure why there would be a difference in texture, but I think there is. I don't use the illuminator very much---I would rather have the other end be a brush or a concealer---but it's a nice touch on my eyes and also adds a luminous quality to the lip color, which I like. I would rarely use this as a highlighter on my cheek bones, but as far as highlighters go, this one is subtle and beautiful. My skin is fair to light, eyes blue and hair blonde. Bare is the perfect blush product for me in color and texture.

blush,,Wander Beauty On-The-Glow Blush and Illuminator,elizabeth31,,,"['Age 25-34', 'Skin Tone Fair']",4 stars,4 Apr 2017,no,,,,I like that this is 2 in 1. I'd say the highlighter is better than the blush. Both are very blendable and subtle. The blush just doesn't seem to add much color for me. The highlighter adds a subtle glow without being too shiny or iridescent. Good to add a little finish to an everyday look.,12,1,

The blush end is a perfect creamy, rosy-berry hue that is great for my fair complexion. I've used the illuminator on my eyes, lips, and as a highlighter, and out looks beautiful everywhere... It just doesn't get any better! My skin is combination, with the dreaded larger pores and this doesn't settle and make them look larger. I'll but again, for sure!

Like I just slightly pinched my own cheeks. And for the illuminator - before I was using Benefit's ""Watt's Up"" highlight stick, and I found it pulled my skin when I applied it directly to my face. With Wander's highlighter, it is so creamy, it slides on like butter. Highly recommend if you're looking for an on-the-go makeup stick!

I was about to return it because the blush kept coming out too sheer, but I tried it one last time because it's my only blush at the time and I needed some color in my face to counteract all the washing out my almost-black lipstick did. I used a heavier hand and was quite pleased at how pretty it came out. I have a naturally heavy hand so this suits me just fine. The illuminator works fine and I never had a complaint about it. I might buy another one, but I probably won't recommend this to a friend because the cost is almost unjustifiable for something this sheer.

I found it thanks to a wonderful employee at my local store. It has a smoother, easier to blend texture than some other brands (some ""cream"" blushes feel basically like lip balm... not so with this one.) The Soft Pink/Nude glow color is a beautiful cool pink, the kind that looks great on everyone. I was also about to buy the Becca poured highlighter in Opal, but didn't need to since the illuminator end of this product is extremely similar to the Becca product. I really didn't want a light highlight on my face, just a glow. The color blends in perfectly to my very fair skin. For me, that's exactly what I wanted. It's so easy for me to look like I have too much blush on, but it's pretty easy to control this product and apply just a bit. If you love super heavy blush and contour, this product is probably not for you. If you are fair, tend to be afraid of blush and want something sheer and light, this may be great for you!

I did however find that this product was a little dry at first and it takes some building up. I feel like I'm wasting a little product because I'm spending so much time trying to build it up I think I would have been better off with finding another cream stick blush and Illuminator separates. If you're willing to work with the product it does work wonderfully and I found that once you receive the color that you're going for it does last for quite some time as long as you have prepped your face and like I always do spray my face with the Urban Decay all nighter setter.
