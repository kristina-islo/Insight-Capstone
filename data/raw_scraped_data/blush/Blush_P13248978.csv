blush,NARS,NARS Orgasm Illuminating Loose Powder,sephoramember7,Insider,Rookie,"['Eye Color Brown', 'Hair color Black', 'Skin Tone Medium', 'Skin Type Normal']",5 stars,18 d ago,no,Color: Orgasm,https://www.sephora.com/productimages/sku/s2063741+sw.jpg,why don’t more people talk about this?,"Such an intense glow. I love the way it blends with my blush and bronzer & makes my skin look like glass. Not at all chunky. Looks glittery sitting in the package but once applied it’s a skin like finish. As with any loose highlight I prefer to use my fingers as it allows the product to really adhere and melt into the skin. If you have fair skin, since there’s only shade, you may wanna go into the store and make sure it’s not too deep of a shade for you.

The color really compliments my brown skin. Like many other reviewers mentioned, a little goes a long way! Because this is a loose powder, it can very easier get all over your countertop if you’re not careful. My biggest tip (that I wish I did when I first bought it) is to poke holes in the plastic film rather than peel it off. I will usually just use the amount left on the lid to apply my highlight and build if I need to. I do wish I had a little more control over it, but the pros definitely outweigh any packaging cons!

Left it in my makeup box and forgot about it since. Now, fast forward months and months ahead, saw this little product and decided to give a try as a highlight for my make up look. I was a complete fool to have not played with this as soon as I had it. I have this and a Mac pearlescent loose powder that I use for highlight depending on whether I’m going for more of pink-gold focus or a copper-gold focus look. I have always been a fan of that wet/sheen/glean highlight look that could possibly blind someone with the right angle and this product gives me that especially when I wet my brush. I apply it to the apples of my cheeks and my cheek bone and I absolutely love the finish. This is a pink/gold product but depending on when the light hits it either turns up pink or gold so almost like Rosegold and I couldn’t be happier. The shine is also very long lasting as well. The product looks small, but because it is a loose powder, it will last you for a very very very very very very very VERY long time. Will definitely be re-purchasing maybe in the next two years when I’ve finally finished this product.

I’m not a huge fan of how messy the packaging is because the blush sort of gets everywhere but I still love the product itself so much I’ll keep it at 5 stars.

I have 2 of the Nars Liquid Blushes, 1 in Orgasm and 1 in Torrid and I use this illuminating powder on top of both blushes to give them both a pop of glow. It does the job without it looking cakey or giving me added texture to my skin. I tried using it as a highlight on the bridge of my nose but I was not fond of it there since it gave that flush of pinky orgasm hue. I'm not going for that look on my nose! Lol. Yes, the container is small and the amount inside of it is smaller, but with that said, it will STILL last me at least a year and that is with every day use. You have to be careful with the amount you use so you do not look like you just have frost on your cheeks. Also a tip, while you pull off the plastic tape covering the holes of the container, pull slowly to avoid a puff of highlighter getting everywhere. No need for me to stock up on this stuff since it will last a super long time. It's a nice highlighter for that nice glow that looks NATURAL!

It was all over my hands, my counter, and the outside of the container in less than 2 seconds. Once I cleaned it up and tried the product I thought it was ok. Maybe I was too annoyed at that point but I felt it went on kind of patchy. It wasn’t smooth like I expected. When I closed the lid, powder was stuck all over the rim and sides and flew out again! The materials the container is made of makes it hard to clean and I didn’t want to put it in my makeup bag and get shimmery powder on everything in it. At that point I threw it in the trash. I was too mad to give it away or even return it. Such a waste for what had the potential to be amazing! For the price and the quality I have learned to expect from NARS, this was a dismal failure. If the packaging was better and the product smoother, I would try again. As of now it’s a hard pass!

Nars products have always been good to me so I’ll continue to use them :) I’ve had lots of compliments on my highlight since wearing this. This is a must have especially for going out!!

I have very, very sensitive skin, and I have to scan the ingredients in any product that comes near my face. Since I can't find the ingredients list ANYWHERE on the internet for this product, I blindly ordered it. So if you want the ingredients, here they are: INGREDIENTS: SODIUM DEHYDROACEPATE · SORBIC ACID · POTASSIUM SORBATE ·TIN OXIED · CARMINE (CI 75470) · IRON OXIDES (CI 77491)· MICA  ·TITANIUM DIOXIDE (CI 77891)  Thankfully, this worked out for me. I have light olive skin and (dyed) red hair. My skin is super oily, but I still have always liked how highlighters look. Unfortunately, my skin can't handle silicones ans oils so I haven't been able to use any. This product fit the bill, and im so happy it did! I just use my fingers to tap a bit above the apples of my cheeks and im set. The color is a sheer pink, with just the right amount of sheen/""sparkle"". Does it replace blush? No, but it compliments it beautifully. Its also a gorgeous eye shadow, and wonderful on the chest and shoulders. As far as how to open it, here is what I did: when u first remove the cap, there will be a white sticker. I poked 3 holes with a toothpick through the sticker, and left the sticker on. I have yet to have it make even the slightest mess. I feel the price is fair for the amount you get. A little goes a VERY long way.

During the VIB sale I had been wandering around the store and played around with this and thought it was really pretty but didn’t buy it because I didn’t know what to do with it. I saw Patrick Starrr use this in a tutorial and immediately bought it after I figured out what to do. This is my new and only highlighter that I actually use. I have issues with pores and some texture to my skin as well as being an oil producing machine. So, even though I have accumulated a ton of amazing and beautiful highlighters, I rarely use them because either by mid-day they make me look like a grease ball or exaggerate texture. This gives me that glow without any problems and I feel like my makeup looks modern and complete. I genuinely hope this is never discontinued because it’s not the same as the blush - this is not like a loose powder version of the blush. I also think it’s a little shiny to use as a blush - on me it looks best with a matte-ish cheek color and then applying this with a fan brush for a bit of highlight. I can definitely see this being really great for anyone with aging skin to add highlight without emphasizing texture. My only complaint is the packaging - mostly fine but once you pull off the seal it’s hard to keep the product from coming up into the top and it can get messy.

It always pulled too peach on me and was too bright even with a light hand. I’m not a huge blush fan in general either. This loose powder must have been sent from the makeup gods and goddesses because it’s truly perfection! Mr. Nars is legendary for his overall aesthetic and color choices. This formula is how Orgasm was meant to be worn! Sheer natural glow that melts into the skin and is reminiscent of the act itself. I’m buying a million backups and hope NARS gives some of their other iconic cheek colors the same reinvention in this formula. A+++

The product isn’t exactly sparkly (think glitter), it’s more of a pearlescent sheen. You have to be very careful when opening it because the little black surface with the holes is a soft plastic, not hard, so it rises up with the tape and bounces back down as the tape releases, getting powder everywhere. I turn the product upside down, flip it right side up, tap the lid a few times to get the excess off, and then I open it. By swirling my brush on the inside of the top, I find I have enough product to do everything I need. It’s perfect for a blush, highlighter, eye shadow, and I’m sure there are other purposes that it could be used for. I love this as a blush for every day wear.

(MUST HAVE),"I absolutely love the infamous Nars shade ""orgasm"". I own the blush, and the multi stick in orgasm. It's one of the most beautiful, universal shades I've ever seen. I went to my local Sephora (I like to shop in store, so I can touch and feel things, test products out). I seen that Nars dropped a limited edition ""Orgasm"" line, and seen the 3 products. I already own the blush, but the lippie (sold out) and the brand new illuminating loose powder in the shade ""orgasm"" is part of the collection. I was intrigued when I tested the loose powder on the back of my hand. Just a tiny swipe, and the back of my hand looked stunning!! For 30 bucks, you would expect to get more product, but after owning this, I beg to differ. 30 bucks is perfect for this, due to you only needing just a tiny bit depending on the look your going for. This illuminating loose powder is BOMB!!! I use this mostly as my highlighter and a blush topper. Orgasm as a ""highlighter"" shade is absolutely gorgeous on my olive skin, EXPECIALLY on top of my favorite bronzer (The ABH bronzer in shade saddle) Just a tip, when you first open it, don't rip the plastic off. Take a tack and poke holes through the plastic, so you can control how much comes out, and it doesn't get messy. All I have to do is shake it just a little bit, and just a little bit comes out of the holes. I swipe my fan brush through it, then apply to the top of my cheekbones. I layer it 2 to 3 times. The ending result is super pretty!! Wayne Goss was even raving about this product as a highlighter. I also use it as a blush topper, and to highlight the points of my face. This product is amazing, and has so many uses. It can be used all over the face, eyes, chest, lips, collar bone, ect. All you need is just a little bit, and so it's worth the 30 bucks to me all day long. I usually use the ABH amreezy highlighter, but this nars loose powder in orgasm has slowly become my new favorite. If your contemplating, BUY IT!! Don't hesitate!

It’s got a nice light rosey shade with a tidbit of shimmer and a little bit goes quite a long way! I wear it over primer and my bareMinerals foundation. It’s smooth and light.

This product has brought me into the world of loose pigment/powder. But can we do something about that sticker? I tried to peel off the sticker that covers the holes (as i knew no other way to go about opening the product) and the powder exploded everywhere and so much wasted. That was upsetting but still love the product.,1,0,Recommends this product

I went to the mall for a graduation dress and left with this instead. Wore a night dress under my cap and gown but girl was i glowing. NARS Orgasm products have been my favorite since I was 12 and I love loose powder highlights... so this is an angel baby of my dreams. Shouts out NARS for this. Shouts out Starbucks for my paycheck and thanks to whatever stars led me to this heavenly product xoxoXoxoXxXoOOox

This powder is beautiful on and I don’t mind the small packaging because really the tiniest bit with a very light hand goes a very very long way. That being said, I find it almost impossible to get a tiny bit on my brush. The holes on the filter are way too big and from the moment I lifted the seal powder exploded everywhere and it seems to get worse every time I even look in its direction. She beautiful but she a mess guys. Wouldn’t repurchase sadly.

Apparently when you go to check the rules and guidelines regarding reviews, you magically lose everything that you just entered, so here I go again. I was pretty disappointed when I open the package. I will acknowledge that it’s my own fault, I was so excited by the color and everybody raving about it; I needed to add it to my collection immediately. I neglected to read the fine print or any of the reviews. I just tried the powder. I am a loose powder junkie & I love them. The powder went on easily and complements my skin tone and had lots of shine pay back, but then, It was just gone... it went away/faded very quickly. Leaving only a faded reflection of miscellaneous sparkle here and there. I mean it happened in a couple of minutes and it’s gone and that’s not even my main concern. I’m very upset at how small it is. It looks like a travel size or barely over a trial size, Please see the picture down below I have it right next to my trial size of Tarte smooth operator Amazonian powder and my Laura Mercier (what I consider to be a regular sized container of loose powder), It’s barely larger than that than the trial size... I thought this was the size of a normal loose powdered product. (again, this is my own fault), All my loose powder products are that size except this one and I’m really mad that I paid $28 for it. I definitely will not purchase again unless some kind of miracle occurs. And it would have to be some miracle, and for whatever reason, all of the sudden I cannot live without it. But I really don’t see that happening.
