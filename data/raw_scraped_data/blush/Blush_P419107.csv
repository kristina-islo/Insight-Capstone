The applicator makes it super easy to use too! This is definitely a staple in my make up bag. For reference, my skin tone is medium to tan with yellow undertones.

I loved it so much that I purchased Sunkissed as soon as it was back in stock! Sunkissed is more of a burnt brown/terracotta color. My Color IQ is 1Y08 and both Nude Peach and Sunkissed are my favorites!! Both colors are great for the summer and give you that natural suntanned look. Nude Peach is definitely more fun and cute. I had also purchased Sunset Strip but I didn’t like it as much, it was more reddish-rosy on me. I wear these without any foundation or concealer. The formula is creamy, easy to blend and buildable if you want more intensity.

It’s the first time I am trying this product from Nudestix. I was on the hunt for a summer blush that would look natural on me. I could not choose between Sunset Strip and Nude Peach so I bought both of them! I am in love with Nude Peach! It leaves a very natural peachy suntan color that is buildable if I want more intensity. I did not like Sunset Strip as much on me. I had high hopes for it considering how popular it was on YouTube videos. It was more of a reddish-rosy color on me and didn’t feel like it was a natural suntan color. It would be a good color to wear for formal events or to wear on a girls night out. As for the formula, this is new for me and I think I’m addicted to cream blushes now! Colors are great, buildable, easy to apply and blend effortlessly! I also love how compact these sticks are! Easy to travel with for reapplication when needed! I will be trying out more products from this brand.

I realize this is a cream product, but unlike the RMS products..this just feels tacky to me. Furthermore, IMO, this brand does not cater to women of color. The bronzing shade range needs to be extended. I think there are other products that are more worthy of our money. If I have to ask you to include me..then what’s the point? Next!

Applies beautifully in a variety of ways. HOWEVER, the shade does lean a little warm/orange, it's not nearly as neutral/cool as I was lead to believe - at least not on my skin tone. It also has very little product and is kind of pricey -- I think it has the same or almost the same amount of product as the Milk mini bronzer and that's less than half the price. And I really liked the tins at first but the more nudestix products I buy the more annoying they are mostly because while some products can fit multiples in a single tin (ie concealers/lip pencils/tinted blur), with the nudies it's literally only big enough for one so it's kind of silly when the whole stick concept is easy on-the-go makeup so why carry a bulky tin and if it's not to be carried in why does it exist at all. Same for the brush, it is a nice quality brush but it's not great at maintaining pigmentation while blending, seemed to take off product and actually make it less seamless which is a bummer and feels like they probably spend a lot for a nice brush and that tin when both are pretty useless to customers. Wish they would get rid of tins at least, the stick packaging on its own is totally fine. All that said I do like this product and have purchased other versions (Sunkissed, which I first tried in the mini set and looks like a perfect sunburn/tan - gorgeous - and Naughty N' Spice which is a really nice neutral blush shade that leans a bit cooler than the other shades but seems pretty universal tbh can be blended to be very sheer or very rich and pigmented)

Nudestix has the worst customer service ever, but their products are amazing, and the quality of this particular shade is great. I apply it over cream or liquid foundation, and then set with a loose powder I apply with a damp beauty blender, and it lasts all day. With this particular shade, I actually use it in my eye socket, and also my lips. It is the perfect 90's nude opaque on my lips, but sheers out to an amazing almost rosey brownie nude on my cheeks and eyes. I thought it would be only a contour shade, but it is absolutely not. It can be punched up on the cheeks for more color and more 'pop', and used subtly it is a shading and contour-esque color. So versatile, and so beautiful it can work on light to deep skin tones. I had a problem with a kit I bought and reported it to their customer service, and they just blew me off and ignored it, and even rudely dismissed me when I e-mailed asking what was going on, but I'm willing to overlook that b/c the quality of the products is bomb.

The color lasts between 6-8 hours, but I do set it with a powder. This is the first time I've ever purchased a product from this line, but I don't think it will be the last. I wish I had purchased the kit for a few dollars more where it includes the same color I bought (naughty n'spice) along with the highlighter, but I think they only sell that online. I did try applying this straight out of the tube directly onto my cheeks but that just resulted in wasted product. You really do need to apply it in light layers and pat more than rub it into the skin so it melts with whatever you have on underneath. The container these comes in is also cute and convenient. There is a magnifying mirror the full length of the lid that you can use when applying on the go which is helpful. When I was testing out shades one of the SAs recommended that I use a brush over the stick, but I find that I don't need one, and again I've never used the brush attached.

And fairly long-wearing. The only drawback is the price for the amount of product in the bulky packaging, hence 1 star docked. So I look for it in sets rather than individually.

I was willing to put up with the weird choice of brush (it doesn't blend at all, so you have to sort of load up on color to a clownish degree then use the brush to remove product--I did so because couldn't get product on my hands and potentially stain clothing). I even exchanged the it once when the lid to the product wouldn't stay shut--the second one was marginally better so I just stuck with it. But now it's barely four months later and the entire thing has just split and crumbled in a way that makes it impossible to use. Returned.

They don't always love me back. Stick foundation, for example, is a huge no for me as a girl with combination skin- it does no favours for my dry patches and trying to blend it out is usually a nightmare. But stick blush and bronzer? I was willing to open my heart and I'm so glad to report I can fall in love again. The neutral palette! The practicality! The shade of bronze isn't too orange (a collective sigh for all cool-toned ladies in the house). I actually don't apply it directly on my skin, either. Instead, I use a stipple brush to pick up product and diffuse it onto my skin for a more natural look. When I tried it on my lips, I looked like a 90s queen (all that was missing was some MAC lip liner in spice). Hoping to buy one of those delightful nude-toned blushes next.
