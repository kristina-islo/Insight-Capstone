Very portable and travel friendly. I got the color Whisper. Have only used it on my lips, as this shade is fairly close to my own skin tone. On my 2Y04 skin tone, this shade looks very similar to a Kat Von D lipstick that was discontinued due to its name. It also has a similar texture. Matte lip, but I wouldn't say it is creamy. Not overly drying either. However, since I do have dry lips already, I like to add a drop of Fresh Lip Serum or Aerin Lip Conditioner on top.

It reminds me of a lip pencil BeneFit used to have, but discontinued years ago, Ripe is a pinky-peach color with a slight sheen. It looks beautiful on my lips and on my cheeks. My only problem with it i it's a bit soft for Arizona makeup during hot weather. If I carry it around with me in hot weather, it melts. I keep it in my bathroom, and it's fine to use in the morning. As a blush it lasts all day. However,I'm one of those people who needs to reapply lipstick, but I can't carry this one around in the summertime. It's not moisturizing on my lips, either. It doesn't really dry them, but I like some moisture in my lipsticks.

It looks great to have a matching lip and cheek colour and this is worth having, simply for the fact that it's two products in one. The alternate lid with the sharpener attached is handy. The case with mirror is a nice place to store the sharpener at home while carrying the lip/cheek stick with regular lid in my purse. I recommend applying to the lips first to warm up the temperature of the product before placing on cheeks. Although it has a natural look, it adds just enough colour to be pretty. This is suitable for all occasions and if I had to pick only one make-up product for the rest of my life, this would be it.

I got the Whisper shade of this pencil and I never knew there was such a perfect nude shade for my lips... Literally, every nude lipstick/gloss/anything I've ever tried has made me look sick and washed out. I have pale yellow-toned skin and once upon a time I found a shade I loved from Buxom but it was discontinued, so sadly, I gave up on ever wearing a nude lip again. What a miracle that I found this. Whisper is absolute perfection. As if the color alone wasn't enough, the formula is wonderful too. It keeps my lips moisturized and doesn't settle into lines or bleed. Not to mention, I've been using it for weeks and still haven't had to sharpen it! A little goes a long way... I will definitely be buying more of these. Consider me converted :)

I see that the formula settles into the tiny lines on my lips, even after exfoliation. There's also a scent to it, similar to that of cheap crayons or colored pencils, and I find that the packaging is great since it comes with a built in sharpener, but I think that's why it smells like colored pencils.

This pencil is almost too creamy for lips, and since it settled into my lip lines it wasn't very attractive. Also as people have mentioned before, it smells/tastes like a crayon. It worked great as a cheek color, it blended well and looked natural, but it was a tad too sparkly for my preference. Since it only served one function for me I definitely wouldn't pay this price for it.

I love the natural shade! It applies easily and is wonderfully moisturizing. I have been sitting in my room doing nothing for just an hour or two, though, and already it seems to have faded and spread... Perhaps a primer or lipliner would bring this product to its full potential. It's just too creamy on its own. It does blend easily, though-- I combined it with a matte Sephora lipstick for a perfect blend! It stuck better, too. Packaging is just too much. A tin for every purchase? How wasteful! This company would do better to offer a recycling program at least.

I feel you should have an option when purchasing more to just buy the pencil alone and a lesser price. I do not need tin after tin and all the sharpeners.

HOWEVER, I have been searching for a really pretty pink lip colour that isn't too ""old lady"" looking on me, This isn't it, I am afraid. It's probably very nice on young, smooth lips, but when I wear it on my lips, I look like I'm trying too hard to find my youth again. I will mix the colour with a nude lip colour to tone it down. As a blush, it's quite pretty, but doesn't last very well (I find this to be the case with most cream blushes). The formula is lovely - soft and creamy. May try another colour.

I have mystic and I keep it in my makeup bag at all times. It doesn't sit heavily on the lips like a lot of lipsticks do and doesn't accentuate the wrinkles on my lips at all. In fact, it makes my lips look smoother. **Just a tip, the colours are quite different in person than they are on the website. If you can get to a sephora where these pencils are sold, I would recommend that rather than choosing the colours online. If the entire collection is not sold at your store, there are usually dual ended pencils in the travel section where they have two shades in one pencil. That way, you can swatch some of them before purchasing online.
