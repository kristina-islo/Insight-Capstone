I purchased the milk cheek and lip stick Andre months ago and fell on love with the cream formulation for blushes, I have always used powders. this Bounce Blush is my second blush THAT isn't powder and I LOVE IT SO MUCH. I purchased it in the color ""be my first kiss"" which, to me, as a bit of am orange like tone to it? o don't know, I'm terrible at describing colors but it looks amazing with my skin tone. I'm very pale and warmer colors usually look better on it. it's a very smooth whipped cream, not to heavy or thick at all. but not watery either. when you apply it you need very very little and you get this perfect glowing look. I'm telling you, it's just like the product description says. it's also buildable so if you want a deeper color you can, which I also love. it's not the strongest pop of color like some blushes I have, more natural. but I think it's perfect and while I just received it today it did stay on perfectly for the 5-6 hours I wore it. the only thing I put over it was bare minerals finishing powder and I had nothing underneath. I'm not sure how if would do with other products though and I also want to say that I have oily skin. it doesn't have an oily look or shine to it and I did not notice it making my skin more oily threw the day so flags good too. if you're on the fence just do it, you'll love it. and don't be fooled by the small jar, a little goes a long way.

If you’re not familiar with cream blush this may be tricky. I put this on right after primer, under my foundation. I’m 57 y.o., therefore do not use as much concealer on my under eye, nose, and face as younger people do, so it’s got a sheer coat over it. I then follow up with a bounce blush. It gives a very natural tint that way. I don’t care much for the package design, as it can be messy. There is a cardboard type lid on it with a foil seal that I leave in the cap for extra sealing purposes.

I meant to get My First Love but this color came in the mail but I actually love this color for summer. It looks crazy hot pink but when on it just looks a bit more than a natural blush! Perfect for spring and summer. You get what you pay for and it doesn't last as long as I would like but you can always reapply and I think it is worth the money. The pot is small but you barely need any to get a lot of pigment so I think it will last a long time

This is beaufiul but you need to start with a LIGHT hand and blend like there is no tomorrow. I use a comed very densely packed brush designed for cream products, after using my pinkie (yes the pinkie cause you literally do not need much.) and then blend quickly with the brush first by swirling the by almost stamping and blending color on the cheek bones. If they come out with more color tone colors, I'll buy in aheart beat. beautiful and the price perfect. yes the package is small but you do not need much.

I didn't mind the size of the product because I knew it would be a very tiny pot, but what disappointed me is a performance of it. This product has a mousse texture, it sits on top of skin, and fades really quick if applied on top of other products like sunscreen or bb cream/foundation (1-2 hours max before faded away). Its best performance is applied by stippling brush on bare skin (3-4 hours max before faded away). If you're applied with finger, most of the pigment will stick on your finger, not on your cheek. I have light skin tone and this color shows on me as very sheer wash of peach-coral which I like. just hope it stay a bit longer. I will continue using it, but won't repurchase. Attached picture is swatches on my bare skin with stippling brush (left: 1 layer, right: 2 layers).

When I purchased it, the photo on the Sephora website was of a cool toned pinky mauve shade. In the ‘details’ section it also stated this shade was a cool dusty pink. However, some time after I purchased it the online photos were updated and now the shade I purchased is attached to a coral pink photo which is the colour I received. What’s even more confusing is that in the ‘Details’ section it still says Be My First Kiss is a dusty cool pink. Regardless of the issues with shade mixup, I didn’t find the actual product to be very good. The pot is extremely small (expected for the price) and the jelly formula balls up on my skin, is streaky and doesn’t last. If you can see the colours in person so you’re sure you’re getting what you want, it might not be a bad way to try a jelly formula, but if you have oily skin I’d skip this.
