It is the first one that isn’t super pigmented that brings life to my face. I feel bronzed and summery yet elegant and not childish. It’s a nice blend. I need to see how shimmery it is in the sunlight, but I don’t think the slight shimmer is a deal breaker. Looks great in low light. Pretty.",0,0,Recommends this product

I was going back and forth with a few colors that I had in a blush. One was pink, bronze and a brown matte. This one seems to have a combination off all those tones and it also shimmers.
