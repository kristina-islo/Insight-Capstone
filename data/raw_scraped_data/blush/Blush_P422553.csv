It is more tan and peachy than it appears in the picture here, but I knew that based on online reviews. This blush gives a very natural color to the cheeks. It has a sheen to it that looks like good skin and does not emphasize my pores which are about average size in that area. . It is perfect for the warm summer days ahead. Since this is a somewhat expensive item, I am going to pick up Love Lust during the upcoming sale. That one seems to be red based and will go with my pinker makeup looks.

But, the Tom Ford blush FAR EXCEEDS all blushes in the market. The pigmentation is out of this world. A little goes a very long way. No doubt this blush is expensive, but it will last you a long time depending on the shade that you buy. If you buy Ravish or Love Lust, then you only need a little amount because it's so pigmented! Inhibition is also a gorgeous blush to use in the summertime with orange/coral lips and a bronze/gold eye look. FYI I'm East Indian with NC35 skin tone during the winter and NC40 in the summer.

With that said, Im still a bit torn on if it is worth it. I don't notice longer staying power than the Flower beauty blush that is similar in color. This was a blush I have been eyeballing for over a year. I finally bit the bullet and decided I would try it as it came highly recommended. Now I do buy a lot of high end and sometimes I find it is worth the cost (like the Chanel blush) but sometimes I just can't see how Im getting a product worth the $. I have a feeling that while I like the color it just doesn't wow me enough (like the Chanel one did) to keep it.

blush,TOM FORD,TOM FORD Cheek Color,kittycatgirlmeow,Rouge,Rookie,"['Eye Color Brown', 'Hair color Brunette', 'Skin Tone Light', 'Skin Type Dry']",2 stars,3 Jun 2019,no,,,Better options out there imo,"Not the worst blush I've tried, but I don't think its worth the cost. Firstly, it doesn't last over an hour. I do like the pigment and color, however. Others have described it as ""frosty"" which is true because the powder doesn't melt onto the skin, it just sits on top. The shimmer then creates a frosty look. I have Armani blush with shimmer that looks natural because it blends so much better. Going back...no way for $60.

So with that, all the pretty pink blushes out there are a no go for me sadly. What was a GO for me was the shade Inhibition!! It’s registering very pink on the site but I would suggest you google image any of these blushes. Inhibition is this perfect brown-peach-but not harsh-natural PERFECTION. It doesn’t hurt to add that you literally have to take a baby swipe with a brush and it is full of product with glorious pigmentation. Seriously so impressed and will never look at another blush the same way. Purchase was 210% worth it to me. I will be buying Love Lust once the warmer weather rolls around for where I live.
