blush,NATASHA DENONA,Natasha Denona Bloom Blush & Glow Palette,AGMD,Rouge,Rookie,"['Eye Color Blue', 'Hair color Brunette', 'Skin Tone Fair', 'Skin Type Dry']",5 stars,14 d ago,yes,,,Still works with my fair skin!,"This is a great palette. I think natasha denona is more known for her eyeshadows which are great but she also does cheek palettes very well. I have very fair skin and this still works for me. The deeper shade I need just a dab for my whole cheeks. I usually prefer using the cream base and then the bottom right highlighter for blush on my skin type. If you have medium or deep skin you will love this palette.

The right amount of subtle sparkle and tone of color. I use it every day and look forward to the finished desired look I want to achieve. I feel very beautiful when I wear Denona's lightest pink shade high on my cheek bone , the whole palette is a win and I would recommend this palette to every glow look seeker. I even pulled off the red it was adventurous.

Layer all 4 together if you want a killer glow. I use the glow cream base regularly & I've hit pan. It creates a beautiful & natural flush of colour.

Highly Recommend!,"I have to admit that I was initially intimidated by this palette. I am VERY fair, and this palette works for me! I use the tiniest amount of the cream blush, and it’s beautiful. It blends nicely. A little goes a long way. I can see it working for all skin tones because this cream blush is extremely pigmented. The two powders compliment the blush beautifully. It adds a peachy vibe. This is now the blush I use every day. I didn’t know blush could be like this! I have already ordered the other blush palette - the Love Palette. I can’t wait to try it!

blush,NATASHA DENONA,Natasha Denona Bloom Blush & Glow Palette,Loroone,Rouge,Rookie,"['Eye Color Blue', 'Hair color Brunette', 'Skin Tone Light', 'Skin Type Dry']",5 stars,30 Apr 2020,yes,,,So worth it!,"One of those products I’ve looked at but never pulled the trigger bc “I have so many blushes already“...finally gave it a shot and so glad I did. It’s such a great color on my fair skin. It would look good on any shade though. Gives me a beautiful rosy cheek, stays, no breakouts (I usually don’t with new makeup), honestly, no complaints at all. I generally don’t go for a intense highlight and this doesn’t do that. It could, but with a light hand it’s perfect and easy. I for sure don’t need to buy any other blushes and in fact, might as well get rid of some now bc this is definitely my go-to. Big fan, this won’t be my last ND purchase

This may be top five purchases of 2019. I will try to go use another blush in my collection and find myself comparing it to this product. It looks mega dark, but it applies like a natural flush (of course you can build it up). The bottom right highlighter that’s like almost duo chrome is nice on application on the cheeks and even more gorgeous as a one swipe eyeshadow. I use the bottom left as of my favorite highlights.

The pigmentation is perfect and leaves a beautiful shimmering finish I don't even need to wear highlight. If you mix the bottom right shade with the two cream shades up top... the result is gorgeous!

It represents Nars Orgasm blush which doubles as a highlighter. It is Fenty Beauty Yacht Life and Trippin. It is Gurlain Four Seasons in 07 Ebony which I have purchased three times and no longer have. Yet, it is so much more. Sheer Perfection. Unrivalled in its pigmentation, reflectivity, and even the colors themselves. All of my dreams practically packaged in one timeless pallet. For once, the hype was real. Truly a gem in the industry.

Having the two creams separated by an additional cover protects them from getting caked in flyaway glitter; genuinely one of the best packaging designs I've had on a makeup product. The two cream bases are very true to the color in the pan. They can be applied sheerly for lighter color and blend out very well, and they have great build-up. The powder blush has a lovely peachy shimmer to it, and it looks SO beautiful over the lighter cream base! The highlight has some serious sheen to it, though make sure to tap off your brush since there's a bit of fallout. The absolute best BEST part about this palette though is that you can use it for a full look! The nice range of color/textures let's you use it for eyeshadow and blush, and it makes for an amazing travel palette. I'm obsessed with eye makeup, so to be able to travel with just the one palette and still get a cohesive eye-face look is amazing! Depending on how much you build up the darker cream blush on your lids, you can rock a look that just flirts with a splash of color, or do an intense pop for a night out! Pat on a little bit of the cream blush on your lips too, and you're golden! On a scale of 1 to even I just can't with this palette

The top left is extremely subtle so if you're extra like me it may not be enough. Also, the highlighter on the bottom left has glitter in it so if you don't like glitter this may be a problem for you. It's very fine glitter but glitter none the less. I truly feel this palette looks best with all 4 shades on. But no way does it look all glowy like the natasha denona video demo.

If you don't like sparkle this probably isn't for you. It did take me a couple tries to figure it out so I would suggest watching Natasha's tutorials because once you know how to use it this palette is stunning. However, the glow extreme does tend to bring out texture so something to consider.

I'm pretty pale, so like many others, I was worried about the dark cream blush working for me. However, by just using a little of it on a denser brush, it blends out beautifully and looks so natural on my skin! I've also been able to use that shade and the others to do my eyeshadow and my lips, and everything looks exquisite. Additionally, the packaging is both beautiful and very well designed. The way the cream products are protected is creative and smart. Overall, glad I bit the bullet.

I don’t like a really beaming highlight so I use very little. I also don’t like the chunky glitter, you have to be careful when you are applying the glow extreme it has chunky glitter in it so I rarely use that shade.

I got this palette six months ago, and I was initially drawn in by the coral packaging. Four powders in one by a brand I love? Lots of good reviews on the Sephora site? Done. That was enough to convince me, but now after this a bit, I am glad I trusted the rave reviews. I especially appreciate the variety of formulas- four different kinds, each beautiful in its own way. My personal favorite is the duo glow in vibrant, golden coral. It makes an excellent blush or blush topper, depending upon your skin tone... and the same is true for every shade. I've seen very fair ladies use the Fuschia cream blush with a light hand, and I've seen deeper-complected ladies use the nude champagne shade as a cheek or brow bone highlight. But is it worth the $55? If you're on the fence, I'd say get it.. it's sturdy, has a magnetic clasp, efficient, and you'd get a lot of use out of it. Is it a must have? No. Makeup never is! Save that money if you'd prefer. I'm more proud of my credit score than my makeup collection :D

blush,NATASHA DENONA,Natasha Denona Bloom Blush & Glow Palette,danihawk,VIB,Rookie,"['Eye Color Blue', 'Hair color Blonde', 'Skin Tone Fair', 'Skin Type Combination']",5 stars,2 Sep 2019,no,,,"incredibly versatile palette, easy to use","I rarely invest in palettes because I usually end up using 1-2 shades I really like, and this is especially true for highlighter/blush palettes. That said I saw this palette featured in Allure and the shades were so beautiful I had to check it out. I'm not a makeup pro by any means, and I found it incredibly easy to use. The deepest shade is what drew me to the palette and it's as close as I've seen to a blush that looks like a natural flush worn on its own. A little goes a LONG way, which is a bonus because it should last a long time! It can also be used as a matte lip stain that's very comparable to Urban Decay Lo-Fi Lip Mousse. The peach powder can be layered over for a more glam/glowy look. The cream highlight gives a natural glow even on very fair skin, and the powder highlight is great for accenting the inner corners of the eyes and brow bones. This is an outstanding cruelty-free, travel-friendly palette that I'll use every day.

I layer all of the products like she does in the video (I highly recommend watching her tutorials), and I get loads of compliments on my smooth complexion and highlight. The blush has INSANE pigment, so I tap into it very gently with my BB, and press/sweep it onto my skin. The color is universally flattering, and makes for a beautiful pale pink to light berry cheek. But girl/guy.. this highlight though. My Lord. Its intense in a subtle way.. it's not one of those, ""look at this blinding streak of shiney stuff on my face."" It's more the, ""oh, what a soft and pretty highlight"" and then the right light hits it and it punches you in the face. Get it. Punch people in the face. You know you want to.

I use the two cream shades for a more natural look, and layer all four when I'm feeling like I want a more glam (but still office appropriate) look. Sometimes I think the highlighter shade is a wee bit too glittery, but I just buff in another, glitter-free highlighter over it to tone it down a notch. I was worried the blush colour would be too dark for my very fair skin, but as long as I use a light hand, it imparts a really nice, natural flush of colour. I've used this every day since I got it, and I find myself really disliking the look of my powder blushes now. I really, really hope these come out in more colour varieties soon!

But be cautious.,"This gives me a natural blush look and I love it! The highlights? POPPIN! But DO NOT use a heavy hand with the cream blush. Even if you tap your blender in it the slightest bit, make sure you still tap some off on the back of your hand because it is PIGMENTED. And if you do put on too much, DO NOT use your beauty blender in hopes it’ll soak up some product because it will just spread even more. (At least i know it’s blendable and stays true in color though). But if you cannot help in being heavy handed, I would suggest applying the blush before foundation. It will still give you a nice flush of color.
