It basically adds a little color to your lips or your cheeks but it's not overbearing, it's the kind of thing you wear on a chill day.

And to top it off, the screw dealie at the bottom broke after three uses, and the product will no longer advance up the tube. I can still apply it with my fingers, but it's certainly not ideal.

Blends out pretty well and the texture is different than other cream blushes, so the sheen makes my me look almost more awake somehow. My only grip with this product is how tiny this product is. This is the same size as the minis I have of their blush and highlight sticks. I really don’t get why it’s so small? Meanwhile their other stock products are big and have much better value. For the price it’s fine but if they came out with a “jumbo” version, that would be perfect.

Also, it isn’t sticky on your lips and it feels very moisturizing. I like to put it on, then top it with a shimmery (but sheer) lip gloss. Best to put a sheer gloss on top so to not take away from the gorgeous color this prospect displays on your lips. Try it!

I would describe this formula as balmy and it blends like a dream and LASTS. I use the shade ""Glimmer,"" which gives off the much-desired ""I was just out in the sun"" look - It is packed with a lot of yummy micro-shimmer and gives off a slight duo-chrome effect which I didn't think I'd like but SIKE, its beautiful and doesn't read as shimmer/sparkle on the skin. I wish there was a full-size of this (like the size of the other stick products from Milk) because this has become an easy holy grail for some stain-like colour on the cheeks and an ""I just ate a popsicle"" kiss of colour on the lips.

As with many lip colors, it does not appear to cause my lips to chap - though I always use lip moisturizer when I lie down for sleep. I was nervous about my cheeks breaking out and have not had that issue, either. There is no discernible smell or taste, which I suppose is good (though I’d kind of enjoy a fruity smell and taste).

The convenience of a stick format is nice, and I can apply it either straight from the tube or with fingers/sponge -- either way works and blends well. I do find it feels slightly tacky on the skin and because of this, it can transfer. However, my biggest gripe is that the colour I bought, Flare, is NOT as pictured. Though it's a very lovely colour, it's basically just pink in the tube and pink on the skin. There's zero orange, and that's kind of why I bought it.

I bought every color. With a little bit of concealer and the oil on my lips, cheeks, and eyes I can go out looking flawless. They illuminate and give this really pretty glow. Highly recommend these.",1,0,Recommends this product

So excited. I use a brush and stipple it on my apples. The color is great and bright but I’m pretty pale. I also put it on my lips. Feels great. I gave it 4 stars and this is my fault, i didn’t realize it was mine size. So i was shocked when i pulled it out and compared it to my other blush stick from MILK. I just didn’t read the details maybe.",0,0,Recommends this product

I'm obsessed with this! I wore it today through 33 degree celsius weather where I was sweating and it also stayed perfectly in place through walking in the rain. It was so sticky and humid and gross outside and I always wipe all of my makeup off by touching my face, but this didn't budge. It stayed on for a total of 13 hours! It is a stunning colour and it blends so easily and seamlessly. I personally like this blush better than any of my nudestix matte or bloom cream blushes. Highly HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!!!!!!!!

I wouldn’t really recommend this oil based blush for people who prefer a full beat face. I personally feel like this compliments on its own or with a tinted moisturizer such as NARS or a water based sheer coverage foundation. Overall if you’re someone who just want a cute summer glow that doesn’t wear a lot of makeup then this is for you personally. I wish these were in bigger sizes than just a mini version.

I overall really like the look. I have used on both lip and cheek and find it works well for both. It is quite long lasting on the cheeks and worked almost as a stain for the lips. Yes this product is mini which I figured it was as it’s priced the same as all other milk mini sticks. My only issue with this is is does have glitter in it which I didn’t know buying it. Because of that it’s not as much of an everyday staple that I wanted and more a fun some time product
