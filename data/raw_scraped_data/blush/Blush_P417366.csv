This duo kept catching my eye and I finally purchased it. During the summer time, this was a great multi-purpose product for me; I used it on the cheeks and on my eyes. Not to mention, bronze warm tones are my go-to! I think this is too expensive for what it is (though you are also paying top $ for the brand name). If you can, I recommend swatching this product in person and deciding for yourself. Now that it is becoming colder, I reach for this a lot less. I don't think it is worth buying exclusively as a highlighter as there are so many great ones on the market that aren't as expensive and are just as beautiful. I have fair skin, but could see this being a staple product for those with deeper skin tones.

However, the highlighters give the most beautiful, subtle glow that I've ever seen. Other highlighters I own are Becca and Algenist and Cover FX. All of these are amazing, yet TF still beats them.

blush,TOM FORD,TOM FORD Sheer Highlighting Duo,katsanc,,,"['Age 25-34', 'Skin Type Oily', 'Skin Tone Medium', 'Eye Color Green']",4 stars,16 Jun 2017,no,,,What a highlight should be,"This highlight duo is spectacular. Be warned- this duo is NOT for fair skin unless you want to use it more as an all over bronze or blush topper. I have medium-lightish skin and it's nearly too dark for me. Either way, I prefer highlight that is blended around the whole cheek area, so this is absolute perfection. It's sooo glossy and I don't agree with the name that it's sheer. I sweep from the apple of my cheek up to my eye and voila, perfection. I took off 1 star because while the packaging is pretty and sleek, it does have a plastic cheap feel. For the price, this should be a bit more luxurious. PS- This has NO glitter, praise Jesus.

I bought this during the VIBRouge sale and haven't been able to stop using it since! I thought I was going to love the gold highlight more because gold highlighters look better on my brown caramel skin but I love the rose gold shade more, but it doesn't matter because I always mix them together anyway. This highlighter is like nothing I've seen it just glows and really becomes your skin so it just looks natural! This is the first highlighter that is so pretty on I had a hard time stopping myself from constantly applying lol. It doesn't emphasize my texture like other highlighters! It's magic, I am convinced!

blush,TOM FORD,TOM FORD Sheer Highlighting Duo,MMoon02,,,[],4 stars,18 May 2017,no,,,Tom Ford Is Pigmented!,"This highlighter duo says ""sheer"", there is no sheerness to this!! This is fully pigmented, its beautiful its classy, its bright, not too much glitter at all. If you have the extra money i think its defiantly worth it. I gave it a 4 star because of the fact that for the pan size i think its on the smaller side. I think for the price point of $78 dollars it defiantly could be bigger. But in reality also, your paying for the name and the product and the product itself is really amazing.

blush,TOM FORD,TOM FORD Sheer Highlighting Duo,mordia,,,[],3 stars,11 May 2017,no,,,Five for the bottom shade though!,"I can't review the more gold highlight bc it was unfortunately too dark for my skin (I glow in the dark kinda pale). The bottom, cooler toned shade was beautiful, great formula, and didn't emphasize the milia on my cheekbones. However, if I'm going to buy this expensive of a highlighter, everything has to be perfect for me. The packaging wasn't there and I couldn't use the golden shade unless it was an eyeshadow, so this one was returned. Unfortunately. Because I really did like the bottom shade.

blush,TOM FORD,TOM FORD Sheer Highlighting Duo,LittleMissLing,,,[],4 stars,2 May 2017,no,,,Tom Ford Reflects Guilt,"I'm so glad someone else mentioned the packaging. If this were to be judged on packaging alone, I'd dock all but 2 stars. Yes, there is a bag for the compact not unlike Dior. However, there is nothing substantial to the packaging. It feels cheap and plasticky. The magnetic closure is fine, but I prefer something that locks like the Marc Jacobs closure. Now, onto the product. Absolutely stunning and beautiful! The shades look more intense in the pan and even so when swatched with your fingers. I am an NC20 and both shades are beautiful. The top is definitely gold and I use the other highlighter for evenings out or as a blush topper. This is my first Tom Ford purchase and aside from the packaging, I'm glad I purchased this.

blush,TOM FORD,TOM FORD Sheer Highlighting Duo,charleybea,,,"['Age 35-44', 'Skin Type Combination', 'Skin Tone Light', 'Eye Color Green']",4 stars,27 Apr 2017,no,,,Product is great - packaging meh,"First, I think I need to talk about the packaging. Yes-- totally beautiful with the white and gold. However, once I got my hands on it, it feels super light weight and the gold portion is so cheap looking (plastic). Pretty disappointed in that aspect considering the price point. It does have a magnetic closure though, so that part is nice. The highlighters are gorgeous! The colors are darker in person than what it shows on screen, but they still do their job well. I am currently between light and medium skin tone and both colors work well for me. It's finely milled, but I do catch bits of glitter when I look in the mirror. Not chunky by any means, but they reflect for sure. Overall, I'm very happy with the actual product. I could do without the baggie and have the packaging reflect more on the luxe spectrum considering the brand. 4 stars considering the actual product inside is so pretty.

blush,TOM FORD,TOM FORD Sheer Highlighting Duo,tryingtosoothe,,,"['Age 25-34', 'Skin Type Combination', 'Skin Tone Fair']",5 stars,25 Mar 2017,no,,,Fair skinned and LOVE IT.,"Being a fair skinned girl (NC-20), I wasnt sure if this was going to work for me. I tried on the top pan and yes, it definitely leans towards the golden spectrum(usually golden highlights show up as a dark stripe on my skin), but I wore it out today and it didnt feel misplaced at all. The reflects in this is gorgeous, and I definitely did admire its shine throughout the day. I think this swatches lighter on skin than it looks in pan. The bottom pan is definitely darker than my normal skin, but would be wearable where I have applied blush, or in the summertime when I get darker. One thing I did not expect is the blinding finish of this product. I wouldnt say its glittery, but its definitely not a subtle highlight. I usually find Tom Ford glitter products very subtle, sophisticated and hard to apply(the holiday eye and cheek palette was very disappointing for me), but this is a completely different product, and Im pleasantly surprised. I hope when Tom Ford releases their next holiday eye and cheek palette, they make it with this formula. One tip: products with the cross hatch imprint on the makeup is a gel-based formula. I will be looking out for more products of his with the cross hatch as I have been having success with them.

blush,TOM FORD,TOM FORD Sheer Highlighting Duo,danajay,,,[],5 stars,23 Mar 2017,no,,,GORGEOUS!!!,"This highlight is everything!!!! I honestly had low expectations because it's Tom Ford and a lot of his products aren't that pigmented to me (minus the lip products). I contemplated returning this before it was delivered to my door step. Just bought it for the hype. I thought this would be another product where you're just paying for the fancy packaging and the name. The swatches on my hand were very blah, but when I applied it to the high points of my face with a basic highlighter brush, it was STUNNING!!! I'm blown away. This is more gorgeous than the becca highlighters and the anastasia ones. If you are looking for a subtle glow, I wouldn't buy this. The title says ""sheer"" but it's definitely that beam you can see from mars. Def would look even more beautiful on deeper skin. I can't see this working on very fair skin girls. Both colors are super golden.
