I highly recommend this product if you are looking for a good quality brush.

It's a satin finish, and definitely pigmented so use a light hand, but it's not HARD to keep it light either. tap your brush in slightly then just blend onto your cheeks. do NOT tap hard, even if your brush look like there's no pigment on it, because trust me, it's there. The satin finish makes it look so natural, not too shiny nor too mat. I have around NC20-25 asian neutral-warm skintone, and this looks GORGEOUS on me (most reds tend to look amazing actually). I have also used this on my eyes (both in my crease and on my eyelid) to tie my cheeck and eye look together. A tiny tiny bit goes a long way. I absolutely adore this blush, easy to blend out, and as long as I remember to not tap too hard with my brush, it looks amazing. Even if you're pale/light skinned, please don't feel scared away by this! I swear it's actually pretty easy to keep it toned down!
