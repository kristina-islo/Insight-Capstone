I got the color Flowerchild and it is truly the most beautiful blush I have ever used. It is a gorgeous light coral pink color with little flecks of gold shimmer. You honestly don't even need highlighter when you use this blush. It is basically everything NARS Orgasm tries to be but fails at. Also, a little goes a long way, you need only one swipe and the color lasts all day. I have been using for 3 months and haven't even made a dent in it. I am a makeup junkie and I recommend this product. The only downside is you need to make sure you don't drop it cause it is soft (mineral texture) and could break if it falls on a hard surface.

My disappointment didn’t last long, because with BARELY a tap of my brush, I was able to sweep so much pigment onto my cheeks. That one tap was almost too much, I had to dab some off! This shade is true to color, so bold but can be diluted to look so natural. No caking, and doesn’t add texture to my already textured cheeks. I’ve had the same blush for a year without hitting pan, and since I don’t wear this color every day, it will continue to last me a while. Worth the money, because it’s better quality than some multiple blush pans I own.
