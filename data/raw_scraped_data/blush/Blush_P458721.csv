blush,GUERLAIN,Guerlain Meteorites 3-in-1 Highlighting and Illuminating Pressed Powder Palette,Yoriel,Rouge,Rookie,"['Eye Color Brown', 'Hair color Brunette', 'Skin Tone Medium', 'Skin Type Dry']",4 stars,5 d ago,no,,,Luxurious Experience!,"This is beyond stunning! You actually get the typical amount of product in highlighter trios like the Hourglass and the Charlotte Tilbury Bar of Gold Palette. I know it looks like less, but it’s not. The powders are beautiful and luminous. They don’t emphasize texture and blend into the skin beautifully. I uploaded a review and comparison of the shades to my channel... search PersonalBeautyLab. I took off a star because the shades could stand to be a bit more inclusive—especially the pink—but you can of course mix and match to customize your glow!

blush,GUERLAIN,Guerlain Meteorites 3-in-1 Highlighting and Illuminating Pressed Powder Palette,sephoriopian,Rouge,Rookie,"['Age 25-34', 'Eye Color Blue', 'Hair color Brunette', 'Skin Tone Porcelain', 'Skin Type Dry']",4 stars,11 d ago,no,,,Gorgeous Highlighter Trio - Heavily Scented,"This is a beautiful palette! The 3 shades are flattering and soft. You do not need to use a heavy hand with these! The palette is larger than I expected (in a good way!) and the compact is sleek and beautiful! My only dislike is the smell! It's insanely strong. So strong that I did very light swatches on my hand and the smell still lingered there after washing. It's very perfume - like. I can even smell it in my room while the compact sits safely in a drawer. Just keep this in mind if you have a sensitivity to strong smells. Other than that I love this highlighter! I know the price tag may seem steep to some, but if you break it down and view it as 3 different highlighters in one compact the price is more palatable.
