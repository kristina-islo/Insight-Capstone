A little goes a long way so a bottle of this stuff will last you a long time. Maybe even too much product in this bottle because you may not finish it up before it expires.

Most days I like to use this all over my face as a base and then just add concealer where needed. It is hydrating, smoothing, and a great texture for applying any other product on top. There is no glitter, it is an opalescent glow that flashes very slight pink pearl when the light hits your face. I am very fair but think this would look good on any skin tone. With that being said, I also tried #2 as a sample recently, and it was completely different, like not even close to being the same product? it was greasy and had glitter chunks... horrible. So if you got that sample don't be scared away from #7.

I originally was looking for something with a very natural finish, but still a little bit of coverage. I am a devout believer of the Luminous Silk Foundation, so I thought I might stick with the brand. Although this product does not cover really anything at all, the brilliance and illumination of the face is beyond beautiful. My favorite way to use this is to cover problem areas with concealer, then put the fluid sheer on the areas of my face that the natural light would hit (almost like a highlighter) and blend a little more out than usual, so it covers a bigger surface area than highlighter. As someone who has worked in hair and makeup for many many years, I am impressed. Beautiful results. Very versatile product.

I had been using Hourglass for a few months when I got this as a deluxe sample and I've never looked back. Fluid Sheer in 7 is now my go to and I can't imagine using anything else. It looks like pearl essence. It leaves you seriously glowing but without that fake sparkle so many highlighters have. This stuff is magic. I also use it on my shoulders and collar bone when going out at night. Color: I use 7, which looks very light but it only deposits the pearl glow, not color. I started using this in the spring and have since developed a deep tan and it still works wonderfully on my skin.

I don't generally like samples of products because I don't feel like you ever get enough to know if it's worth it but this totally changed my mind! I have very dry skin and bad color unevenness. I'm apparently horrible at applying full coverage foundation -- it always looks packed on my face. I have tried a lot of different types of foundation and never been happy with the results. But this?! I apply it after a shower and let it dry a bit and it pretty much eliminates all my red areas!! Without making my skin look loaded with product. I was so shocked I had to try again another day to believe it lol. I can then apply a bit of powder to the top of my cheeks, forehead, and chin then lock and while if I have a blemish it's obviously not going to hide it, my skin looks awesome?! I'm convinced you could put full coverage foundation over this but I don't think this would be the best primer for that, but if you want light coverage and even skin tone this is the way to go. I'm even going to swallow the expensive price tag for it lol.

It's in a similar bottle to Armani's serum foundation, but it's not the same thing. I thought that would be pretty clear by the bright pink and bronze colored bottles... guess not. Use this like you would Becca's liquid shimmering skin perfectors or Nars' liquid luminizers (if the # you bought is one of the light shimmery options, obvi.) You can mix it into your normal foundation to add glow and a more dewy appearance, or you can pat it on the high points of your face with fingers or a beauty blender, (after your foundation) to get a more specific highlight instead of an all over glow. In that sense, they are like the coverfx enhancer drops, except much much more subtle and not as metallic. The pink and the bronze versions can be used like a liquid blush or bronzer, just apply lightly after your foundation in the normal spots and blend with a damp beauty blender (or a stippling brush or the like). You could also use them (especially the lightest pink, speaking from my own experience) to tone down the yellow in not-quite-right foundation shades, or to play up the cool tones in an otherwise neutral one. In all, the only complaint I have is about the price, but like the coverfx drops, this stuff lasts forever, and the smaller versions they offer now allow you to try some of the shades without shelling out quite as much $$. Otherwise, love it. Remember guys, it's not a foundation. It's a subtle enhancer. Nothing over the top, very refined. Plus, it's super versatile because you can use it in so many ways-- just see what works best for you! :)

I've been looking for something to work as a soft illuminator, just to add some glow to my cheeks especially. My assessment on this product is that it absolutely isn't worth the effort. The fluid is very thin and watery, full of glitter, and that glitter can come in large clumps. It doesn't come out smoothly at all. Essentially, if you apply it lightly over your cheeks as they suggest, you're just smearing glittery water on. There's no subtlety - and I was left shedding glitter all day. Furthermore, when I applied this I was left with a greasy sensation. I have sensitive skin and this product made me break out after one wear. I can see where someone might consider mixing this into a liquid foundation, but I feel as if the clumpy consistency of the glitter is a deterrent to that working well. Additionally, I can't imagine cleaning this out of a brush or sponge: getting it off of my hands was bad enough. Ultimately, wearing this product made me feel like I got lost in a kindergartener's craft kit. All sparkle with no subtlety or care for quality.

It is one of the only liquid illuminators that doesn't break me out/get greasy over the day. I like to blend a few drops of this with my long-wearing foundation - it adds a great ""dewiness"" without ruining the coverage or performance of the foundation, which tends to look pretty ""flat"" on its own. The shimmer is so, SO fine that there is no glittery look at all, which I love. I've found it wonderful for boosting my dull winter complexion. It is scentless and blends very easily. It costs a pretty penny, but a little bit goes a long way, and it really does do a great job adding a natural, youthful glow without looking greasy, glittery, or compromising the staying power of your regular makeup. Highly recommended for anyone who likes a long-wearing foundation but still wants a pretty, natural glow.
