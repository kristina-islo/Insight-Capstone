So what I do use two fingers and make a line with the blush were I want it and slightly rub with fingers and then I use the blush brush.

I went for the middle color, Atmosphere, and it's just a tad too bright for a more neutral / everyday look, but I tend to like bright makeup, so once spring comes and we're having… uhh less of a pandemic… I will look forward to going outside with a cute, pink face. I really like the texture, it's what drew me to this in the first place. It's very light, not nearly as heavy or smear-y as the MILK highlighters. The only downside is that it can be a little more difficult to blend out compared to powder blushes.

I recently started getting back into blush after my acne scars cleared up but I hate blushes that are overly shimmery or emphasize any leftover texture or pigmentation I have. This blush doesn't do that, it blends out so naturally and is an AMAZING color for my extremely fair skin. If you're pale like me (we're talking lighter than most foundation ranges go type of light) don't be afraid to skip over the pink blush and get this one. It is pigmented but blends out nicely. I recommend that you apply with fingers and you can blend with them as well, but I prefer using a Real Techniques foundation brush to get it looking more seamless. This was exactly what I was looking for and personally I prefer this over the heart stamp blush also offered by Kaja.

I have combination acne prone skin and I currently have some blemishes on my cheek area but when I applied this blush it managed to make my skin look amazing despite some pimples. It’s very buildable and natural but definitely noticeable as it gives off a healthy glow from within. This blush doubles as a highlighter as well so if you’re looking for something travel friendly this is a great product. There’s no frgrance at all and it comes with a tiny mirror.
