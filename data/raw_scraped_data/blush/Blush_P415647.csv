In theory... I returned this (Diabolique) within 72 hrs of receiving it and instead got ""Beloved"", which was a SLIGHT improvement.. This is just a *huge* no. Both of them settled into the fine lines in my lips on application, caused my lips to chap more, it wipes off almost completely if you do anything with your mouth (rubbing your lips together, adding chapstick under/over, drinking/eating, dabbing your lips, transfers easy, etc.). The same applies for the cheek wear. (You're better off buying a mini from Milk Makeup). I thought it would be worth the money, it isn't. If you want to spend this much for a subtle color, go with YSL sheer lip. I would not ever recommend this for ANYONE.

I don’t wear foundation due to my skin being so sensitive, therefore I wear concealer: Carmel in the Bars soft matte and 345 in Fenty beauty concealer.

The color is a little more on the cool tone so it gives this refined appearance when I wear it at work. It also shows up nicely on Zoom meetings. No breakouts and I wear this on my lips and eyelids. This is an all year round color that I find myself continuing to grab.

I own almost every different product they have in their line. I have the shades Diabolique, Spell, Beloved, and Demure in the Lip2Cheek’s. Diabolique is by far my favorite. All the shades are luminous without being overly oily. I tend not to like dual lip and cheek products. I think most I have tried looks great on the cheeks but is drying on the lips. I’m not sure how they created such a great product but it works no matter where I put it. All shades I have tried are easy to blend and wear well, even for my oily skin. You can wear them sheer or really build up some intense color. I use a lot of rms products every day and it works beautifully with the new foundation or even on bare skin. They also play nicely with other foundations I own. It doesn’t slide around my face or move my foundation around under where I place the blush.

I definitely preferred this as a cheek product than a lippy - it just faded quick on my lips it was like a tinted balm almost. I did end up returning the product, however, because it just wasn’t compatible with my other makeup products (the formula does not hold up great apparently, as per RMS, if you have silicones or hyaluronic Acid underneath) and it faded a bit quickly unless I had no makeup on. But if you use their other products or any other “clean” products, or aren’t a foundation fan/use powder foundation even I’d say this could work for you!! I didn’t have issue applying this overtop of powder either which was great. It blends like a dream with fingers and I barely needed any product so while it’s a lot of money for the amount, I seriously see this lasting someone ages - definitely as long as any other blush product that has a larger oz. size since I literally only tapped my one finger a couple times in it and that was enough! I wish this worked out for me this time but if I ever get their un-coverup, I’d absolutely repurchase this! Also, if you have dry skin skin like myself, this brand has an awesome balance of giving your skin a fresh and hydrated look (not oily, or accentuating dry spots at all! If anything it moisturizes).

They are buildable, but I would say that they aren’t all that less pigmented on the skin as they are in the pot, for me. For my skin tone, beloved was too much/too red.

Initially I didn't like how buttery the formula felt, but it's surprisingly not greasy or uncomfortable on the skin. I don't find this is super moisturising on the lips however - I would only use it applied over lip balm. This colour actually also looks very pretty lightly applied on the eyelids!

My skin tone is light olive, and have almost black hair and the color demure gives me a beautiful innocent youthful look. The color Curious surprisingly looks good too, like when I was a kid and went out to play outside and my cheeks got flushed from running around :-)

blush,RMS BEAUTY,rms beauty Lip2Cheek,emeritus,,,[],3 stars,15 Aug 2017,no,,,,"I liked the colour, but was not impressed with the quality of the container nor the product. For the price I paid, I expected a higher quality product. The colour is nice though!",1,2,
blush,RMS BEAUTY,rms beauty Lip2Cheek,itscarin,,,"['Age 25-34', 'Skin Tone Olive', 'Eye Color Brown']",5 stars,13 Jul 2017,no,,,Beautiful color,Got this in beloved and it's a beautiful color. It's so pigmented you only need to lightly tap it to pick up enough product. It's definitely my go-to 'natural look' blush that I keep in my makeup bag for on the go touch ups,8,1,
blush,RMS BEAUTY,rms beauty Lip2Cheek,SMC03,,,[],5 stars,23 Jun 2017,no,,,IMPRESSED,I got the shade vogue rose (in the vogue x birch box) it is hard to blend on the cheek but if you use a beauty blender it looks BEAUTIFUL!! Super natural! It hydrates my lips and goes on nicely,1,1,
blush,RMS BEAUTY,rms beauty Lip2Cheek,farrahk,,,[],2 stars,21 Jun 2017,no,,,old lipstick smell,"I bought this in illusive, which is the exact neutral i was searching for (medium yellow skintone). However, the ""gone bad"" lipstick is hard to ignore and it doesn't seem to be one bad one because i did exchange the first one. But the second one also has tge same problem. Will not repurchase this (love the bronzer though!)",10,7,
blush,RMS BEAUTY,rms beauty Lip2Cheek,beauteous,,,"['Age over 54', 'Skin Tone Medium', 'Eye Color Green']",5 stars,14 Jun 2017,no,,,Sheer radiance,I was skeptical about purchasing this since I'm 57 and have oily skin. I thought it would just melt off. But happily I am wrong! I love this so much I bought another color! Goes on silkily and stays put. A little goes a long way. Makes your blush look so natural. Love it.,12,2,
blush,RMS BEAUTY,rms beauty Lip2Cheek,SammieJL,,,"['Age 25-34', 'Skin Tone Fair', 'Eye Color Hazel']",2 stars,20 May 2017,no,,,Disappointing Texture,"I wanted to love this product - the shades are lovely, its eco-friendly, and the brand has been getting a lot of buzz. Unfortunately RMS Lip2Cheek doesn't age well., Though at first its texture goes on very nicely, after about 1 month the product separates - oil gathers on the top while the rest of the product is very dry. I have two pots of Lip2Cheek and almost never use them because its so much hassle mixing the shade back to a usable texture. Won't be buying again.

blush,RMS BEAUTY,rms beauty Lip2Cheek,KrisBrecks,,,"['Age 25-34', 'Skin Tone Fair', 'Eye Color Green']",4 stars,15 May 2017,no,,,So close to perfect,"I love the texture of this product and I really like the clean ingredient list. I just wish that it lasted longer. I think that's kind of the tradeoff when you switch to natural products. I use ""beloved"" and it's a nice punchy red. I like how you can build the colour nicely. Like other RMS products a little bit goes a long way!",14,2,
blush,RMS BEAUTY,rms beauty Lip2Cheek,Liz1312,,,[],5 stars,11 May 2017,no,,,green beauty godsend,"I have spent the last six months switching over to green beauty products, after discovering that many of the ingredients used routinely in cosmetics could very well exacerbate a hormonal condition I have. RMS beauty may be my new favorite brand. This line is really for a natural, dewy, inner beauty kind of look, which isn't everyone's cup of tea, but I just love it. I have the lip2cheek in promise, which on my light, warm-toned skin is an extremely natural flush, and smile, which is brighter and more playful. I love them so much I just ordered spell, curious, and diabolique!

blush,RMS BEAUTY,rms beauty Lip2Cheek,,,,[],2 stars,22 Feb 2017,no,,,,Creamy and not particularly long lasting on the cheeks. Very short acting on the lips. Had a bad smell like old lipstick that has been sitting around for 30 years. Will return.,15,6,

This is truly ""on-the-go"" makeup which is the PERFECT, natural pop of colour. If wish for a more matte look, simply pat with RMS Un-powder. Fav: Spell for a nude, natural look on the cheeks & lips. I am truly in a spell.",9,1,
blush,RMS BEAUTY,rms beauty Lip2Cheek,mandy417,,,[],5 stars,18 Jan 2017,no,,,gorgeous,I picked up demure and it's a beautiful pink that gives just the little pop of colour I was looking for - the coverage is so light and sheet but can be built up for more intense colour,11,1,
blush,RMS BEAUTY,rms beauty Lip2Cheek,sarahsxt,,,[],5 stars,16 Jan 2017,no,,,,"I absolutely adore Diabolique and Promise. They're the only lip colours I wear and create such an unique fresh off the runway look. Not exactly a traditional lipstick but so much more than a stain. Be warned, the gorgeous frosty glass container BREAKS, so if you want to carry it around i highly recommend transporting in a plastic container a little bit at a time. Also, the coconut oil will melt in high heat.

blush,RMS BEAUTY,rms beauty Lip2Cheek,summer322,,,[],4 stars,13 Jan 2017,no,,,nearly perfect,"I had been eyeing this for so long and I was so excited when I finally ordered it, and wasn't disappointed when I received it. I bought the color diabolique, and it can be layered for a more dramatic/opaque color, but I love doing a flushed look on my lips and my cheeks. I've had it since August, and about a month in, it started drying out, and I screw the lid on completely. All I have to do is warm it up with my finger and it's fine but I expected a better lifespan for 36 dollars. Other than that, I'm 100% happy with this product! It lasts a long time, and it's so versatile. Great with sensitive skin and even better because no animals were harmed :)
