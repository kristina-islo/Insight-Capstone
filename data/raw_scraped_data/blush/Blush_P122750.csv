blush,CLINIQUE,CLINIQUE Soft-Pressed Powder Blusher,MB36,Insider,Rookie,"['Eye Color Brown', 'Hair color Brunette', 'Skin Tone Medium', 'Skin Type Dry']",1 star,22 d ago,yes,Color: Plum Gorgeous,https://www.sephora.com/productimages/sku/s54312+sw.jpg,product,"This has been my favorite blush on me for years. I’ve used many different brands, colors, and formulas. Plum gorgeous was the color that always looked best against my skin so I always went back to it. I recently ordered it, after not using it for years, and I have been so disappointed. The blush is so hard that I have to scrape it loose with a metal file then try to pick it up with a blush brush. It is CLEARLY very old & outdated. Very disappointing...I plan on returning it. Guess I will have to find my new holy grail blush color.

This blush hardly has any color payoff. I have to keep applying over and over for ten or twenty times to have the color show up on my skin. And since it appears light, I never tried to see whether it lasted. New clover is a nice shade though. However what you want from a blush isn't to make you look like having no blush on and this is what the product does.

It's not harsh and really gives your face a gentle healthy glow, I would recommend having a consultant choose the right color for you, that really makes all the difference.

I will say it does not make my skin break out, which is a good thing. Also, the blush lasts a long time.

blush,CLINIQUE,CLINIQUE Soft-Pressed Powder Blusher,Ben05,,,"['Age 18-24', 'Eye Color Brown', 'Skin Tone Medium']",5 stars,3 Nov 2009,no,,,Most natural blush. No bias,"I received this blush from my step mother in law in ""New Clover"" color. It went on so natural on my cheek. When I put it on, my cheek will look like it has a natural flush on it. Though it is so natural, the color does compliment and brighten my face. I have the Asian skin color (kind of yellow + very light tan). Before, I thought that coral color would be good on my face, but it just blended into my skin totally. Then, I thought that peachy pink color like NARs Orgasm will be good as many people recommend it, but it did make my skin look darker! The glitter on it also made me look like having a lot of make up on, and unnatural (regardless of what other people said) I did not like this, and I asked my step mother in law to try on her cheek color (She has very fair skin like other European) And wow!! the color matches my skin unbelievably!! It so nice and creamy on my cheek. So, she gave it to me as she thought that it matches me so well. I will continue using this color ""New Clover"" for sure. Maybe you can get this color at the counter as Sephora does not have it. P.S. I hope this is useful to some Asian girls with very light tan like me. The glister on cheek products does not give you that GLOW as you think. The glow must come from inside of you and your skin, not by glister! It makes your make up look thick. Believe me. But, I think it could be good if you wear it to a party at night.

For me it's similar to another fav & fab Blush -Tarte ""Flush"". In the winter months I really like ""Plum Gorgeous""... but with a bronzer, tan, or a fake bake, this color is beautiful year round. (Plus I don't need to use as much) When using ""New Clover"" I always use too much (wait!) It's on purpose, then add plenty of mineral powder over top. This has helped my blusher's last longer on many occasion- Since the mineral powder disapates more quickly than the Blush does~ By the end of a Long work day...honestly ~ I might need to re-apply once. Unless I'm going out, and that another reason to own at least 2-4 good blushers. (Although you see I'm fair to light skinned,w/Blue eyes. my natural hair color is light Blonde....""BUT!!"" I've found the only other color that looks natural on me is Black ~ So for now I'm raven haired) Thank for leaving the names of your Clinique blush colors, and what they look like on you! So many reviewers forget we depend on that! Plus... I Love rating reviews ~ Oh, no...I will not rate against someone.

blush,CLINIQUE,CLINIQUE Soft-Pressed Powder Blusher,stormstephie,,,"['Age 18-24', 'Eye Color Brown', 'Skin Tone Olive']",4 stars,17 Feb 2009,no,,,New Clover,Its a very natural looking blush. Good for beginners because of its sheer coverage. It's definitely buildable but on my darker skin it takes multiple swipes. Very blendable but not as long lasting as I would like. Not sure how long it stays but upon application in the morning I'd say it's typically gone by the afternoon.,10,0,

I have it in new clover which is slightly pinker/brighter than the swatch appears. I use this blush everyday, it gives great natural tickle me pink coverage. It's great for a flushed look, if you want to give yur cheeks somecolor without looking like someone slapped your cheeks. Also I usually stray away from powders, because I have dry skin but even in winter it's fine and the powder is very light on my skin, I love it!

blush,CLINIQUE,CLINIQUE Soft-Pressed Powder Blusher,shoshannah,,,"['Age 25-34', 'Eye Color Brown', 'Skin Tone Light']",4 stars,9 Dec 2008,no,,,,"I got this blush in New Clover (a matte color) as a gift with purchase from a department store. I'm quite fair (the lightest color when buying Clinique's Superfit foundation) with either yellow or olive undertones (am always told different things by makeup consultants), and this looks very natural on me. The powder is pigmented, and the color is easy to build up to your desired level of intensity. I'm giving this four stars because I don't think it has as much staying power as some other blushes out there, and you may have to reapply once or twice during the day. Also, I prefer blushes in round rather than rectangular packaging as I find them easier to use with my blush brush.

It's very natural looking and you can layer it on top of itself for more intense color in the evening. Clinique Soft-Pressed Powder Blusher has a lot of color choices -- it's the only product where I've found more than one color that I can wear with my very fair skin without looking like a kewpie doll. HATE the brush that comes with it -- it's not good for anything and the fibers start to come out very quickly.
