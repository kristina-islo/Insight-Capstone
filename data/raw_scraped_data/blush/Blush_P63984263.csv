It is pigmented with good payoff, so you don't need a lot on your brush. It is a beautiful peach shade that goes amazingly with the yellow undertones of my skin (I'm half Asian, and I find peach toned makeup suits me best...a lot of straight up pink blushes look clown-like on my cheeks)! This blush's compact is extremely cute, a great size, and the gold on the inside is so pretty! It also has a helpful mirror for on the go. If you don't like scented makeup, be warned as it does have a noticeable peach scent added...but I don't mind it. This blush also has a stunning metallic sheen to it, which adds a beautiful healthy glow to your face!! I love it so much. Will for sure be repurchasing.

I can't imagine how it would even work on any of one darker at all. The scent, of course, like everything in this peach line, is a bit overwhelming and sickly, but again, I had high hopes.

I find it very buildable and gives me a really nice peachy flush. It does at times fade as the day progresses, but I don't find it fades any faster than any of my other blushes. The colour also works great with just about all of my pallets that I use for my eyes and I find myself reaching for it on a very regular basis. I unfortunately never used the original version of this blush, so I can not comment on my thoughts towards the older formulation. I haven't had any problems with the tin in terms of flimsiness or breaking. I find the packaging super cute. The smell is very peachy, but I do not notice it lingering once applied to the face. It reminds me of fuzzy peaches in terms of a scent (more artificial peach vs fresh peaches, but still very pleasant). I will be repurchasing this item once I have used it up.

I remember reading somewhere that if your powder makeup wasn't coming off onto your brush enough, you could try repressing it to try to solve the issue. So I did that with this, I guess because I was having trouble with getting product onto the brush, and that didn't really help at all, or it might have made it even worse (plus it made it really ugly lol).

I have a fairly light completion...for reference I wear the Peach Perfect Foundation in Nude during the summer and a mixture of Nude and Snow in the winter. This blush has the trademark peach sent this line is famous for, and I personally love it, but if you're really sensitive to scents this blush may bother you. I don't find that the scent lingers though, so if you can deal with the scent for a minute, it will go away. I think I've finally found a blush I would buy over and over again.

blush,TOO FACED,Too Faced Sweet Peach Papa Don’t Peach Blush,blueberrysmum,VIB,Rookie,"['Eye Color Blue', 'Hair color Brunette', 'Skin Tone Light', 'Skin Type Dry']",5 stars,23 Sep 2018,no,Color:,https://www.sephora.com/productimages/sku/s1894468+sw.jpg,"Better for ""warmer"" skin tones","Bought this as soon as it was released as peach is one of my favourite scents. This not only has nourishing peach extract but nutritious fig extract in it as well. It's definitely a true peach/ bronzey shade that's well pigmented. I would say it's best for those with warmer undertones. It's shimmery, not glittery. (Think Nars Org-sm with bronze rather than pink tones mixed in). Goes on smoothly with a soft brush but you only need a small amount. Has decent staying power, too. Love the good for you ingredients. I get lots of compliments when I wear this. It's s great blush but just not one of my personal favourite shades as is Perricone's No Blush blush or Nars Org-sm but it does give a healthy, back from holiday glow and the peach scent is a nice pick me up when applying. Too Faced is still one of my go to brands for many other things, especially their Natural Eyes eyeshadow pallette, Better than Sex Mascara, and Hangover Primer which I use in the warmer months. Also, their brushes are great. They're cruelty-free and donate quite a bit to animal welfare charities.

I’m glad I did because it is my new favorite daily blush! I use Too Faced Milk Chocolate Soleil bronzer to contour, Milk Makeup Holographic Powder Quad to highlight then this on the apples of my cheeks. Totally natural looking and the color stays for 12 hours when properly set (I spray & powder set it). I also used this with a smoky eye evening look at it was perfect however I didn’t much like it with natural eye/bold lip. The smell is nice but not overpowering & doesn’t stay on my skin once the blush is applied. I’m light/medium toned (more light this time of year) and needed very little product to get good color. My next purchase will be the lip color in this same shade!

It is the perfect shade to compliment my skintone (fair/ light with neutral undertones). my only complaint is that it is pretty expensive to just be used as a blush topper but it gives my cheeks the most beautiful peachy flush that i cant go without. i use this blush every time i do my makeup no exceptions!!

I'm fair skinned, and I think it applies absolutely beautifully. It doesn't matter what color it is, if you apply too much of any shade you're going to over do it. Learn how much you need to apply to achieve the look you want. All products are different. The shade kind of seems a bit shimmery, but I don't notice when I apply to my face. I wear highlighter anyway :p but I love this product. Buildable, but pigmented at least on my fair skin. I cannot speak on behalf of dark skinned women, but I suggest trying before buying as I'm not sure it will show up much.
