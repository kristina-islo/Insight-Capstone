The colour is absolutely gorgeous and is perfect for people that have a similar skin complexion to the lady isn’t the video. Pops very nicely on the face and gives you a very natural warm tone. I can wear it alone for simple days or I apply it on top of a stronger shade of blush as a topper because it just layers over other blushes beautifully as well.

To be honest, i didnt even buy this blush, i bought the cheekleaders mini, and oh lord. I opened and was already assaulted by the smell. It lead me to google if the blush did have a scent. Hence, the review here. Im sensitive to smell, so something this strong gives me a headache. Oh and then when you swirl it on your cheek. You can still smell it! Once you are done with the application it does disappear. So, if you are sensitive to smell, hold your breath if you apply this. BENEFIT, PLEASE TAKE OUT THE SCENT. THERE IS NO NEED FOR IT.

I'm obsessed with it and I even open up the box and just take a deep whiff. I do wish the gold was mixed in throughout the whole product. And I wish it was offered with as much product volume as the Sugarbomb had (12g!!) This only has 5g!! and seems kind of like a rip off for being the same price.

I have to admit, this isn’t the one I use the most, but I still think it has some good things going for it. First, it’s true that the gold fleck spray on the top of the powder goes away with a few swipes of a brush upon first use, and to me that is a good thing! What you are then left with is a super subtle peach toned blush with some super subtle gold highlight. I have light olive skin, and this took quite a few swipes to build up a noticeable color to my cheeks. I think this would appeal to gals who are super fair skinned and prefer a more natural makeup look. I have a hard time seeing this work well for deeper skin tones and most women of color...this seems tailor made for seriously white girls! I find myself using this most often as an overall setting powder if I want to do a more dewy finish. Would recommend to any light skinned ladies seeking a subtle highlighter than can be built up as a blusher.

The GLITTER is only dusted on the top and goes away with a few uses. I unfortunately sent it back but am thinking of gettting it again now LOL I will like it once i get past the glitter part.

When I saw the swatch of this I knew I had to have it. First of all the smell. Very strong. I didn’t mind it but be warded if you’re sensitive to smells. However that wasn’t the problem. I am a fair-light skin tone and it looked like nothing on me!!! It searched so beautifully and when I applied it. Nothing. So I scraped off the top layer of glitter. Again nothing. So disappointed I wanted the colour it swatched to be what went on my face. I have heard reviews of people that liked it so i dont know what happened. Do not recommend this one but some of their other ones are amazing. Returned it.

I've read other people preferring the gold to wear away (which took 2 brush swipes for me) but the combo was why I got it. i don't like having to apply multiple layers of anything because usually I end up overdoing it, but two layers in and all I see is some shimmer. as much as I get from Sephora, this is one of only 2 other products I will have returned. if you're a fan of subtlety and...pretty packages, I would recommend. I however, am super disappointed.

Wish they would make them without a sent. I still gave it a 2 star because the shade is quite lovely.

In a nutshell, this blush is everything I was hoping it would be. My expectations for Benefit are always high, I'm always hoping their new release will at least match the last one....and it did. I was every bit as pleased with the tone and finish of this blush. It's so natural and buildable, that perfect shade to give you a healthy 'glow'. A couple of things to note: It definitely has a perfume-y scent, so if you are sensitive to that, beware! I also don't know that it is truly 'universally flattering'. I always say this is a high claim because it's truly difficult to produce something that will truly fit all skin tones. I am a light medium with neutral undertones and it is lovely on me. I think it would look good on medium skin tones, but I don't know that it would really show up on my lovelies with deeper skin tones....something to be aware of also. All in all, very happy I purchased this blush and will be putting it to very good use!
