I have bought this product twice and both times the bottle has exploded and ruined everything in my make up bag, including some very expensive brushes. I end up loosing half the blush because the bottle explodes making it not worth the money. This has also happened to a friend of mine so it isn't just me. It is so upsetting that my favorite product is not one that I will be buying again. If I were you you should evaluate if this product is actually worth the money and the mess it makes.

It goes on super natural but leaves your cheeks looking like they have a natural blush. It feels like you have just put on moisturizer. Other brands leave my cheeks feeling oily or like the makeup is caked on, but this feels completely natural. I can wear this with only mascara for a super natural look, or with my full makeup look and it is great for both. It has also lasted me for a very long time. It stays on all day too!

blush,PERRICONE MD,Perricone MD No Makeup Blush,ClaudiaMarina,VIB,Rookie,"['Eye Color Brown', 'Hair color Brunette', 'Skin Tone Tan', 'Skin Type Combination']",5 stars,26 d ago,yes,,,A GAME CHANGER,"This is absolutely everything I didn't know I needed! Trust the process! When I first got it and put the 3 dots on my cheeks (as recommended), I saw the color and I was terrified. But I started blending it with my fingers and it was such a natural, beautiful, true sun-kissed color! It looked like the natural flush I had always wanted to recreate and it stays on! It blends gorgeously on the skin and just fits your skin tone so naturally and effortless. Even my boyfriend commented on how he loved that it looked very natural and like my cheeks were just naturally flushed. I usually wear powder blushes which I personally don't like how they look on my skin and cream blushes I feel look cakey or just greasy on my oily skin. I even wear it on my no-make-up days and it such a natural beautiful look that I can't recommend it enough! Especially for girls like me who are not very skilled at make up, love to stick to one holy grail, and just don't like feeling heavy with make up. 10/10!

My biggest problem with this blush is that it doesn't build up or layer well. You have to put on the perfect amount in one go; if you go back and try to add more it just lifts off the product from underneath and ends up looking really blotchy. The same thing happens if I try to layer liquid or cream highlighter—the blush just blots right off. And as much as this product advertises itself as for a no-makeup look, I can see it sitting on my skin because it dries down to an almost powdery finish. And it doesn't last all day. The packaging is also a messy hassle. The lid was falling apart on day 1, and it gets messy quickly. I could never travel with this. I have also tried the Armani Neo blushes and prefer them. That formula gives a more watercolor effect that looks more natural and is way easier to work with. The shade 30 is similar to this blush.

I have used drugstore brands that lasted longer in cream formulations. Not worth it, even with primer, skipping foundation or using, with setting powder and a powder blush on top.

Now that I’m in my late 50s I’ve given up and am trying to find a better routine than just night cream and mascara. (I’ll write a separate review of the skin care products that have changed my world for the better next.) There are no cosmetic stores nearer than 80 miles from where I live, so on a recent trip I stopped in to a Sephora store for advice and to look in-person look at products. The gal who helped me there was stellar, she read my skin and what would work well immediately. First she mixed a few drops of a softener (Shiseido) with a few drops of a facial oil (Boscia), and pressed that gently over my face and neck. Then she put a little tinted primer on, then finished with 3 dabs of the No-Blush Blush (Perricone) on each cheek, blending it lightly in. The result was the very definition of a natural, healthy perfection - which is saying something for someone who is 57 and pathologically fearful of having thick or powdery makeup accent her imperfections. Now that I’ve bought got it, on busiest mornings I mix it with just my day cream and call it good, but usually I mix a little with a tinted primer (also a Sephora purchase) and it’s been going swimmingly. I LOVE it. And the price, which seemed intimidating at first, has been worth it so far, a bonus being that a little goes a long way. For bold color you’d probably want to add something, but for healthy natural glow, this is it. I’ll be checking out other Perricone products.

I originally tried Benetint bc the smaller size was $12, but it was SO hard to build without looking clownish. This on the other hand, doesn’t need building. I found two drops works for a more natural look (barely there flush). I use three drops on each cheek bc it ends up looking like I applied blush but somehow managed to do it perfectly in my exact flushing color. Hopefully the amount lasts, because it’s expensive for a blush.

Not like dropped them, or I screwed the lid on too tight, but both broke at the lid area...after only a few months of use. I was able to salvage my current bottle, since it was just the actual cap that broke (first one got broken glass in it), by pouring it into a little cosmetic container, but I don't think I'll be repurchasing this SOLELY because of the packaging...which makes me sad, because it's adorable and my favorite blush I've ever owned (I pretty much only wear mascara, eyebrow stuff, a soft highlighter, and blush so it's kind of important). I'm gonna say I don't recommend it, but again ONLY because of my 2 bottles breaking...otherwise it's awesome!

I don't use blush very often during the daytime--especially in the summer when I'm tanned--but like to add a little highlight to the cheekbones in the evening or when my skin tone needs a little boost. A little of this blush gives a very natural highlight to the cheeks. You can also build it up by adding more. If I want a more dramatic look for night, I sometimes add a bit of Josie Maran ""Illuminizer"" or Cheek Gellee. A little goes a long way, so this small bottle lasts a long time.

Even though the idea of liquid blush can be intimidating, it's really easy to use: I use my finger tips in a circular motion to blend it from the apples of my cheeks up my cheek bones. Dusted with a little bronzer on top, it gives an even more beautiful effect. My only complaint is that it doesn't last all day on me - I need a refresher by the end of the work day. But I think it probably lasts better than my favorite powdered blushes - and looks way more natural as well.
