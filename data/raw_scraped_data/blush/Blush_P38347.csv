Even for my light-med skin, this is a good color! At some point I thought this was not meant for my skin tone but after using that little brush, this is one of my favourite blushes. 100% recommend!

It's a soft, powdery formula that applies easily and blends well. It's a soft pink color with a sweet scent that's perfect for a natural everyday look. It's a soft satin finish that lasts all day. This wears well on the skin and does not cause any irritation for my combo/acne prone skin. I have repurchased this many times and have used this for over ten years. This is a very subtle color so I do use quite a bit of product, but I really enjoy the overall look that it gives my complexion. I apply with a MAC 116 brush and not the included brush.

You’ll be disappointed if you are expecting a “wow” highlight. But, I feel like this was meant to be a softer highlight anyway. Only thing I’ll point out is that if you don’t use setting spray over it, it’ll fade quicker than you’d think (it fades quicker than many I’ve used) I can recommend it for sure if you want a hint of glow.

I am in an adolescent age, and my skin has become very oily! I am always trying to focus on good skincare before I can even think about cosmetics. This powder is very lightweight and gives a beautiful finish, very natural, very delicate, and has a elegant sparkle. The only problem is the price as it is a little steep but it is definitely worth it especially because it doesn't contribute to any excess oil on my face and would not harm any skin type. I have medium skin that is usually a bit paler without a suntan (but when living in Los Angeles you can basically get a suntan anytime of the year). The brush that comes with the blush is great too, it is very soft and works well for application. Definitely recommend!

If you are someone who never uses blush, this is the blush for you! This is literally a hybrid between a powder and a blush, almost a non-blush blush, if that makes sense. The color is very buildable and is the most soft, natural looking color of pink I’ve ever seen. I have light olive skin and prefer a very natural makeup look, and in the summertime I can use this all over my face similar to a setting powder. I can use it all year round as a very natural looking blush that instantly perks up a dull or tired looking complexion. I do understand that for people with darker complexions and women of color, this blush might just not show up on them. It’s always worth testing in the department store if you can; even if you don’t like it as a blush you might consider it as a brightening setting powder.
