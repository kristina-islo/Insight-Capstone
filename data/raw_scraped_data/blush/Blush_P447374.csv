blush,BENEFIT COSMETICS,Benefit Cosmetics Lovetint Lip & Cheek Stain,Incipiency,Rouge,Rookie,"['Eye Color Brown', 'Hair color Blonde', 'Skin Tone Light', 'Skin Type Combination']",5 stars,2 d ago,no,,,perfect strawberry reddish pink,"Smaller bottle than I’d thought, but this tint has SOOO much pigment! I used three tiny dots as blush and it was too much. On my complexion, one dab per cheek is just enough. Layers beautifully on the lips. The colour is gorgeous, like a juicy strawberry! New favourite.",0,0,Recommends this product
blush,BENEFIT COSMETICS,Benefit Cosmetics Lovetint Lip & Cheek Stain,FAUGHX,VIB,Rookie,"['Eye Color Hazel', 'Hair color Brunette', 'Skin Tone Fair', 'Skin Type Combination']",5 stars,26 d ago,yes,,,Gradient Lip,"Comfortable on the lips, definitely dries fast as the other reviews has stated and can be a bit drying (I just stick a clear gloss over top). Makes a wonderful gradient lip if you're into that. Lasts a fair amount of time but I do find I have to reapply. Colour is definitely a bright red. The bottle is small but I can still see this lasting a while. A little goes a long way on the cheeks. If you put a small dab on the tip/underside of your nose it creates a really cute just-out-of-the-cold look!

blush,BENEFIT COSMETICS,Benefit Cosmetics Lovetint Lip & Cheek Stain,meggy75,Rouge,Rookie,"['Eye Color Blue', 'Hair color Blonde', 'Skin Tone Light', 'Skin Type Combination']",2 stars,15 Mar 2020,no,,,Not great,The shade is pretty but I don’t feel like it stays on more than a few mins. I have normal/combo skin so I’m not sure why but I’d rather buy a blush stick or a cream blush that stays on longer,7,1,
blush,BENEFIT COSMETICS,Benefit Cosmetics Lovetint Lip & Cheek Stain,Jabadabadoo,Rouge,Rookie,"['Age 25-34', 'Eye Color Brown', 'Hair color Blonde', 'Skin Tone Medium', 'Skin Type Oily']",3 stars,15 Mar 2020,no,,,It’s a nice blush overall,It blushes the way I like. Does not stay on for hours like it said though. Sometimes when I dab it on my the mark stays there so I guess it dries quickly? Not sure. Just ok.,2,1,

blush,BENEFIT COSMETICS,Benefit Cosmetics Lovetint Lip & Cheek Stain,AyeshaAnwar,Insider,Rookie,"['Eye Color Brown', 'Hair color Black', 'Skin Tone Medium']",1 star,15 Jan 2020,no,,,Not impressed,I would not use this as a lip stain since it is very dry. I used is a couple of times and my lips are insanely dry now. Works ok as a cheek tint. Not very impressed though. I ordered online so I can't even return,5,4,
blush,BENEFIT COSMETICS,Benefit Cosmetics Lovetint Lip & Cheek Stain,graacecee,Rouge,Rookie,"['Eye Color Brown', 'Hair color Black', 'Skin Tone Light', 'Skin Type Combination']",5 stars,14 Dec 2019,yes,,,,Very pigmented and the new applicator makes it easier to apply on the lips than their other tints with the brush applicator. The formula is also a little thicker than the original Benetint. Fast drying but the tint doesn't dry out the lips. I like to dab a few dots and then I use my finger to spread out the rest of the product on my lips.,12,0,Recommends this product

blush,BENEFIT COSMETICS,Benefit Cosmetics Lovetint Lip & Cheek Stain,AlligatorWoman,Rouge,Rookie,"['Eye Color Green', 'Hair color Brunette', 'Skin Tone Fair', 'Skin Type Combination']",1 star,6 Nov 2019,yes,,,Stains everything but your lips,"Benefit, what have you done to Benetint?? I used to use the original Benetint twenty years ago. Loved it but I stopped because it really wasn't the right color for me, too pinky purpley. So excited to finally get a red lip stain. This stuff stings, dries out your lips, barely stains them, and gets red on your teeth, cups, anything you touch. Massive disappointment.",18,6,

It has great color control. The more layers applied the intensity of the red increases. You can have a subtle or dramatic look. Doesn't dry the skin or lips. Looks fabulous under a lip gloss without losing the color. Application can last hours.,7,1,Recommends this product

I was so excited to buy this new love tint and I’m freaking obsessed.its the prettiest pink shade. I am in love. It mixes well with my nude glosses and gives a peachy pink shade when I mix.

It’s a waste of money. One of the gals helped me out in the benefit section, applied this product on me, and I ended up looking like asian Ronald Macdonald- not cute.
