While I like that it's glitter free and blends easily, I'm not a fan of the color. The back pigment is pale pink, as described, but what's not mentioned is the odd peachy gold undertone or shift that's really unflattering on my NW10 skintone. I have a strong cool undertone and avoid warm tones because they give my skin a sickly green cast, and this highlight was no exception. I think someone that's also very fair but has a warm undertone may like this but I definitely recommend swatching it in store first.

I tried to layer it with other brushes as well, but it just ends up looking tacky. It’s quite flat and it doesn’t have the shimmer that benefit dandelion does. It also is way too bright.

And I love it!! I have a light complexion, and I know I shouldn't use dark colors, but this is buildable!! So it can be light plum on someone else, while being really plummy, matching my plum lipsticks, and eyes, for me!! Stays very well also - through most of the day, and even into evening!!

When I got home and was able to play around with it I fell in love with it. You can get a more soft glow, or build it up to a more intense glow. Love this and will be trying more from this brand in the future!

Everything I tried ends up just looking either really orange on me, or looks really dark and dirty. Because I am so incredibly pale, it took a long time to find something that works well and is light on the first application. S116 is the perfect one for me! The picture below is a finger swatch that I doubled up (applied, then recoated my finger and applied again on top) so that the colour would show up. it is buildable, but not too dark or harsh on the first application. It looked like it would be way too dark and muddy on me, but after trying it I realized that it is perfect for pale, cool-toned gals like me. If all of the contours you have tried look a little orange on you, try this one! Only downside is that you have to order a container for it, because this is ONLY the pan of product. But the refillable palettes they sell are really nice quality and are only $2. (The size small pallet is the one in my picture, and it fits one pan of this perfectly) I am SO HAPPY to finally have a contour powder that doesnt look orange or dirty on my face!

The refillable palette looks and feels great, plus the mirror is relatively large. I'm very excited to use this when I'm away from home as it is such a great size and the colors are so easy to use and gorgeous. I have only used this on my skin without foundation so far and it blends out well and doesn't exaggerate my pores. I had a lot of fun in store choosing my colors and swatching the samples. I stood in front of the stand for at least twenty minutes just trying to figure out what I wanted for this little face palette because so many of the blushes were beautiful and the experience was so great. This is my first time purchasing Make Up For Ever products, although I do have a mini lipstick sample, and I'm so glad that this is my first real introduction to such an expansive brand. I will definitely be purchasing more blush shades as there were so many that I liked. Most likely, I will create a trio palette of just blush shades! While blush is one of my favorite products in general, the highlighter and contour shades that I chose are also beautiful and have a similar consistency that is easy to blend out. The highlighter I chose is relatively natural on my skin, which is what I generally look for in a highlighter. Overall, I absolutely would absolutely recommend the face palette bundle as it truly is such a great discount for products I am falling in love with.

But as soon as I saw the color I knew it wasn’t what I was looking for. The shimmer factor is on the lower end and the color was a bit too pigmented to make a good highlight. It’s not a terrible product, just didn’t have the glow you’d expect from a highlighter, so be warned",0,0,
