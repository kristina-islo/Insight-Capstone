I expected a lot paying almost 30$ for a blush. I have bought plenty of urban decay ones that I loved but decided to change it up. Wrong choice. The product is fine. I could have bought a blush from the drug store and it would have gave me the same effect. The packaging for the product is ridiculously cheap. I’ve never had a product feel so cheaply made. That has never been a concern for any other $30 blushes I bought in past. The plastic is EXTREMELY CHEAP, and has a loud snap whenever closed. I didn’t realize a company like bare minerals could have the dignity to sell such a cheaply made product. I’m not going to pay almost $30 for cheap quality like this again.

I typically have to stay away from their products because they often contain bismuth, which irritates my sensitive skin. The pan is small, but this stuff is pigmented. Blush is a staple of mine, and I feel like this will last me a long time. I don't wear foundation, so I have to touch this up once during the day if I want all day wear, but I imagine the staying power is better with a base. I have fair skin with neutral/cool undertones, so the color Call My Blush (pink mauve) is the obvious choice, but I love peachy blushes for spring/summer! I think this color would be flattering across a fairly large range of skin colors and undertones. I will definitely by purchasing other colors and repurchasing this color in the future.

I think they have a blush color for all skin types here. It’s so hard to find a blush now days that is not full of glitter/shimmer and still have a good amount of product and are good quality. This blush blends out so easily and it’s easy to pick up color. The texture is great and it last a long time. There is zero fallout in this blush and the packaging is very reliable (I would highly recommend to travelers if they want to feel safe carrying their blushes). It has a loud click you can really tell it’s secure. I have never had a blush I loved so much that I used it to the end and this was the first one to ever do that (note: I have used too faced, tarte, hourglass, nars, urban decay, and benefit blushes). The price you pay for the amount and quality is just perfect! It’s such a fantastic deal! The “That Peach Tho” is good for all year round and I love the Berry and Chocolate blushes for winter! They are drop dead gorgeous then! Seriously give these blushes a try, especially if you have been looking for non shimmery ones! They aren’t so matte that it looks cakey like some matte blushes can look (because they aren’t considered matte). Also, because they aren’t shimmery, they blend extremely well and look like your real, natural blush. If you were to do a no-makeup makeup look, these blushes would really fool others into believing these colors are your true cheek colors.

I needed a matte blush (highlighters show too much texture on my skin) that gave me a warm pop of color. Call My Blush is the perfect blush to do that. I use a technique that I saw on YouTube where you apply the blush in a circular motion going onto and over the eye. I make sure I don't have too much blush on the brush as it is quite pigmented. I layer in this circular motion until I have the color I want then swipe over the cheekbone for extra color in that area. I then apply Hourglass Ambient Diffused Light on top of the blush using the same circular motion to bring some brightness to my face and eye area. This doesn't bring out the texture in my mature skin and it really looks beautiful for a daily routine.
