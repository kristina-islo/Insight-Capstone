Beautiful colour and I like the product, but I believe potential first time buyers should be aware of how little product you receive for the cost. Ive watched plenty of YouTube videos and thought this product was bigger, I wish I had realized how small 25oz is before purchasing. I would still recommend but just know the amount of product you end up receiving. See photo, it is about the same size as my thumb nail. To compare, it is essentially the same size as the Milk Makeup MINI lip and cheek product (only .04oz less) which costs $20.

Used this a couple of times so far: first time I bounced a wet beauty blender sponge onto the stick several times before bouncing it on my cheeks. Looked good, very subtle color on my fair to light skin and dewy, but I also layered it with another peachy blush to bring out the color more - was very nice. But my subsequent tries with either sponge, applying straight from stick to cheeks, or with fingers, I had trouble with my foundation being disturbed underneath. Plus couldn’t get color to be more vibrant as I wanted without fading my foundation too. Resorted to just using for my lips and have been loving it this way - also been searching for a fresh peachy color for lips. This is kind of pricey to just use for lips, but don’t wanna waste and like the color better there. As others have said, it is pretty tacky. Maybe not an issue for some, but I couldn’t work with it. But very nice as a lip color!

It blends out easily with fingers or a brush and leaves a healthy pop of colour, pigmented nicely so you don’t need a lot. It does remain a bit sticky but I personally don’t mind that because I like the “dewy” look from that. It looks “wet” almost. It’s not very long lasting, which is fine, and the brush is kind of pointless - it actually gets pretty gross after a while so I don’t use the brush. Overall I love this and love that it’s a staple in my collection! I can always count on this to make my skin look glowy and healthy even if I am not having a good foundation day.

A nice tip I learned from my favourite makeup artist is to swipe the colour on your cheek, let it sit there; in the meantime, work on your brows or mascara. After a minute or two, the heat of your skin really helps to make the product even more natural and blendable. I then use my (clean) fingers to evenly spread it around. =)

I’ve owned the Nudestix eyeshadows for awhile now and really like them (for many of the same travel reasons and the great quality) so I was looking forward to trying this. And wow, it’s even better than I expected! I bought the Sweet Peach Peony shade and it is THEE perfect glowy peachy pink, which I’m always looking for since I found out that my favorite blush is made by a company that is no longer cruelty free. That blush is Nars Orgasm by the way. It’s not shimmery like Orgasm, but it is an absolutely perfect peachy pink. It’s dewy and more natural looking too. I’ve read some reviews that say it lifts foundation, but I don’t have this problem, as I don’t swipe it across my cheeks or rub it in with my fingers. I dot it on and then stipple it with the brush. I don’t know if this method will work for everyone, as it could be that I don’t use actual foundation. I use tinted moisturizer with loose powder, but if it doesn’t move lighter products like that, I can’t imagine this method would move foundation. Looks beautiful as a lipstick too. I can’t wait to try more shades!

I don’t love it on the lips, but it‘s beautiful on the cheeks. I like it on the eyes as well for a monochromatic look and can see it working for all seasons. I blend it out with my own brush usually or my fingers and it’s super quick and easy. Not sure I’d call it “dewy” but it does give a nice natural looking glow. I am excited to try some of the other colors as well.

I wore it days where I was sweating tons and at the end of the day I was still blushed up. It’s a bit finicky in the application as I have to use certain techniques but it always ends up looking great at the end. I have porcelain skin and the pigment can come off a bit strong initially but once everything is on looks beautiful. I would recommend to everyone but I do have normal, sometimes dry skin so cannot speak on the longevity on combo/oily skin.

I have the original formula, which needs warmed up some to apply/ sheer out over the cheeks, and wanted to give this a try. At first I didn’t think I wanted this as it seemed really gel-like in finish (kind of gooey and wouldn’t dry down) when I applied it in-store using my fingers, but I decided to give it a go and once I got my own I felt the product wasn’t as “wet/ gooey” and I apply it directly to my face and sheer out with my fingers (much easier and faster than the original). It has a bit more color impact than the regular (but those are all nude shades), and it’s way easier to sheer out/ apply. I find the product dries down fine, I like my (curly) hair around my face and I never have it stick when using this product. I will say, like all blushes on me, the color does fade thru-out the day but leaves enough color for dimension.

Overall, this is exactly what I was looking for. My only complaint is that the brush on the other end is very small, making it difficult to blend out over your cheeks easily. Additionally, when I went to wash the brush for the first time a chunk of bristles (probably ~1/3 of the brush) popped out. It would be simple enough to fix but I was disappointed that the brush couldn't withstand being washed especially given that this isn't a cheap product. All in all, I do love the product itself - especially when blended with a beauty blender - for the summer time!

The colors (especially tiger lily queen) are just so beautiful. Very easy to apply and blend. Looks amazingly dewy. I do have to admit that it is slightly tacky but it doesn’t bother me. The color isn’t as long lasting as I would have liked but reapplying does the job. Very much in love with these and definitely a permanent step in my makeup routine!

These are exactly as they say, dewy color. I primarily use these as blush but you can definitely wear these on your lips as well. I apply this directly on the cheeks from the stick and then blend with a beautyblender. These blend out really easy and look so dewy and pretty on the cheeks. I sometimes put a powder blush on top and it looks great as well. I would say these fade after about 4-5 hours so when I put a light powder blush on top it helps the longevity a bit. I am taking a star off for the same reason as the other sticks like this from nudestix, the amount of product you get for the price is a little steep but I'm more okay with it when it comes to a blush because you don't use nearly as much as you do with a bronzer. I also find the brush on the other end is useless, it is too stiff to properly blend and not disturb the other makeup you are wearing. Other than that I love these and will probably buy more and I hope they extend the range in the future.

Unlike some other cream blushes, I find this one lasts throughout the day really well. I also don't feel the need for highlighter when wearing this product because it gives a sheen to the cheeks. I prefer to apply and then blend with my fingers, rather than the brush, as it seems the brush sheers it out a bit too much. Will likely check out the other colours too!
