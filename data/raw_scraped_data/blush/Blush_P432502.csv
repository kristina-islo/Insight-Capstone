It’s a cream gel formula that is extremely pigmented and perfectly shimmery. It’s that wow highlight and you can use it under the brow and inner corner of eye for a gorgeous pop because it’s very noticeable once your wearing it. I can’t believe more people aren’t talking about this but they soon will be since it’s so so beautiful on the skin.

The bottom left shade is gorgeous and gives a lot from within glow, but unfortunately, this fades within an 1-1 1/2 hours (despite being layered, use of primer, setting spray, etc....). What difference does it make if it looks beautiful but is gone so quickly? It’s not like I’m going to carry this around with me and touch up every hour on the hour? Wanted to love because it was beautiful for the very short time it was on but was very disappointed. No other highlighter I own (high end or drugstore), fades this fast.

I had wanted this in Glitz as I liked the colours, but could not get past the micro glitter in it. The four shades in Universal are all lovely and each have the same beautiful smooth, finely milled texture. I find the top two shades less pigmented than the bottom two, but not in a bad way, they are the perfect versatile highlighters that can be worn sheer/glowing from within or built up for a more intense finish. I have never used a white highlighter before and was worried it might look ashy, but Strobe White is very wearable and what I turn to on a light makeup day. Strobe Gold is actually quite similar to Becca Champagne Pop in tone, just a little less peachy, and a lot more natural looking. I didn’t think I would like Blush Pink as much as it’s a cooler tone, but it has actually become a favourite of mine as it is great layered on top of blushes, and I find it makes my face look more “refreshed”. Blush Bronze is a little too dark for my light medium skin tone as a bronzer for natural looks, but like many others have said, it is really, really beautiful on the lid and very buildable. Overall really recommend this palette!

Guess what, I couldn't find it so I bought the 002 Glitz palette. It's amazing. I used to use a separate bronzer, blush, and highlighter but I hated the extra time it took and the fact that I had to use a different brush for each different product. I used a big powder blush to mix all the colors together and swiped it on my face and it looks amazing. It's a great natural color, and it also gives a beautiful glow.

It's got me good for highlight, blush, bronze and eyeshadow. Couldn't be simpler! Just an fyi, the blush is very light in pigment so this won't replace a proper blush if you want really strong color! I really appreciate that the highlight is a shimmer and not glitter. My synthetic brushes pick up product easily. My Tom Ford brushes (the old ones that are fur) also pick up product beautifully.

I left it sitting on my shelf for a few days, but decided to give it another shot for an evening out. I had on foundation, setting powder, etc., and swiped this product on my cheekbones. I immediately noticed the mirror lights pick up the tone (color) of the highlighter and it had a subtle sheen. There was no hint of glitter. I caught my reflection in mirrors several times through the course of the evening and noticed the product gave me a beautiful glowy look. I then tried it on again during the day, on top of my foundation and powder and noticed it really had luster in sunlight which made my skin look healthy and dewy.

After playing with it I have to say it’s a very odd palette that definitely isn’t for everyone. 1st: I think the colors are for fair to light skin only on this one, and maybe not too fair (?) 2nd: the peach highlight is very smooth but it definitely can’t act like a blush, like the pink one can in 001, and it doesn’t show too much as a highlight either on my fair skin—I had to really layer this to get much color or effect on my skin (which is the new lightest shade of foundation Dior makes) 3rd: the top 2 highlights have shimmer in them more suitable for an event or eyeshadow than an everyday highlight 4th: the top left white-yellow highlight is kind of ugly, like an ugly gold with hints of pee green in the shift, and I don’t even like it on my eyes. When packed as an inner corner highlight or center of the eye it’s very green-yellow in color more so than gold. Really the only shade I love is the bronzer, which is beautiful for fair people, and I like the pink highlight at top but I don’t know that I have to have such a shimmery formula. This may go back

Just so blendable and creamy I love this palette so much it makes me come to life and I always get compliments on how my skin looks so healthy when I use this.,4,0,Recommends this product

blush,DIOR,Dior BACKSTAGE Glow Face Palette,jarusza,Insider,Rookie,"['Eye Color Green', 'Hair color Black', 'Skin Tone Light', 'Skin Type Normal']",5 stars,29 Apr 2019,no,,,This sure don't mess around!,"WOW WOW WOW. If I had to sum it up in a single word three times, that would be it. What a palette! I have several Dior highlighters but these seem even more pigmented and beautiful somehow. Yes, the pans are smaller than in other highlighter palettes, but the shades are so incredibly pigmented you don't need them to be any bigger than this. I was originally hesitant about the two bottom shades in particular because I'm quite fair (NC20). But they're both very wearable. The pink looks great over blush or kind of in between blush and a lighter highlighter, and I love to use the bronze shade over top of a matte bronzer to really become a beautiful glowing goddess. I own many, MANY highlighters but this palette lives on my countertop and it's the only one I own where I can actually see myself hitting pan someday. This palette seriously has something for every look and I think it would look great on any skintone (if applied properly). If I had to live with only one highlighter product for the rest of my life, I would choose this one in a heartbeat. I don't even have to take the time to think about that choice!

I was looking between this one and the Charlotte tilbury one and this one is about 10x better. From shades, pigment, and versatility Dior is the best. Not to mention price point.
