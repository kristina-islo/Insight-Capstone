It's really too bad because I was excited about trying this brand. The consistency is really not great to use your fingers because its completely soft and way too much product goes onto your finger even with the lightest swipe. The shimmer in the highlighter has really visible glitter in it which doesn't make for good look in my opinion, very unnatural. Also the pink shade is very pigmented which I guess is great if thats what you're after but not fun to try and create a natural blush look. Will not be buying again.

I actually was back and forth between the high intensity and ""regular"" intensity color before I purchased. I'm glad I got the high intensity because it goes on a deep color but once you mix it then it blends into your skin without looking like you have red red cheeks. It's super creamy too and has a slight shimmer. I mix both colors together. Like a sun kissed glow I find. Only have used it for a couple days so I'm unsure of how long it lasts after a full day but it's very pretty and not sticky even when I'm sweating here in 25 degree weather in Canada! ☀️ my skin is a light olive and this color isn't too pink for me.

I went through and entire Tropic Equiox which I used as a blush/bronzer since I am quite fair. The highlight in that one is more champagne which was my preferred highlight. I recently bought Velvet Melon during the Spring Sale and I love how juicy & pastel the colour is. The name Velvet Melon is the perfect description of the product. The photos on Sephoras website are not accurate so I highly suggest googling swatches. The highlight in Velvet Melon is more pinky VS the champagne in tropic equinox. Another thing that was very interesting was that the shelf life span of my Tropic Equinox was 6 months where as my new Velvet Melon is 18 months. I don't know if they have changed the formula or if they are different depending on the shade ingredients, but it is something to keep in mind. You do have to use creams up faster than powders but these are such beautiful formulas.

The textures of the two products are a bit different- the blush has a bit more stiffness and the highlight is softer and seems to melt right away when you touch it. I have applied them with my fingers, a synthetic brush and a sponge and I definitely prefer to blend out with a brush or sponge. The longevity is surprisingly good.

They say choose a color you naturally blush... unfortunately when I blush my cheeks don't turn any color close to pink or peach. I happen to find on the Kosas website the color Helios which is a burnt orange blush color and a complimentary highlight that made me jump for joy... it is perfect. I tend to go for a more natural makeup look and this fits right in with that aesthetic. The highlighter is a beautiful bronzed gold that just melts into the skin and provides a radiant look that is flattering and unassuming. Great product w/clean ingredients... love Kosas!

I was on the fence between this and the TowerBeauty (didn’t buy both) because I wasn’t sure I would use the highlight side but I am sooo pleased with this product — it’s been a struggle to continue to use my other blush/highlighters.

The packaging is also very pretty and sleek and came with a large mirror. I really wanted to like this after seeing so many fantastic reviews. It seemed like such a simple product to use and based on the videos and pictures I saw, i had the impression that this would be very soft and creamy and thought it would be kind of like softened butter. However, the color just didn't show up. I use Tone 5 and this barely showed up. I had to use quite a lot of product to get a decent amount of color and it didn't even last more than a couple hours. The highlighter looked chunky when I looked in the mirror up close, but from far away, it didn't even look like i applied highlighter. The product was also very sticky (so not like the softened butter I had hoped for!), but it was easy to blend at least. It also had this weird gritty texture (which I did see some people saying they had the same observations). Anyway, maybe I'll give another color a second chance, but will be waiting until the Sephora stores reopen to go see them in-person.

This is one of my all time favorite cream products out there, every single shade is gorgeous and the formula is consistent with all of them. If you're new to cream products then I think this would be a great place to start, it is foolproof. I normally start off applying the blush with my fingers and then go over it with a stippling brush to smooth out the edges and make it more seamless. I know the colors can look intimidating in the pans, but once applied to the cheeks and sheered out they look gorgeous. The highlight is just a true wet looking highlight, no glitter or shimmer in them at all, just a gorgeous glowy look and they just blend in effortlessly. Some cream products are tricky to work with because they can lift the makeup up underneath, but these do not do that at all, I have even applied these over powder and it worked that way too. Both the blush and the highlight are super dewy and don't completely dry down, they do stay just a bit tacky, but not uncomfortable and sticky, so if you have super oily skin then I don't know how well you will like this. I love that they came out with an intense version so people with deeper skin tones can enjoy this product as well, although, even the regular shades can be built up enough where I think they would work with deeper skin tones, but I am very fair so I can't say for sure. The first duo that I bought months ago was Velvet Melon and it is still the exact same formula as the day I opened it, it did not dry out at all. These are pricey for what they are, but I truly think that these are worth every single dollar and if you love cream products or want to start dipping your toes in then this would be a great place to start.

It puts on a bit of delight and motivation to my straight-sheltering-in-place vibe. However, while i like the accompanied highlighter, I don't love it and would rather have more of the blush product. I will also say the product says ""velvet creme"" which I thought would have a more airy, powdery feel but it is more of a satin-type product though the blush does not have an overwhelming shine to it and you could likely add setting powder to create that look.

The colour is everything ( 8th Muse ) is a dusty pinky rose colour , but the effect on the cheeks is like you went for a run and got all flushed. If you’re oilier skin you may not love this as it’s not going to dry down or sink into the cheeks. It does remain dewy and somewhat tacky on the cheeks. But I don’t feel greasy when I wear it. The highlighter is very subtle , so for those who don’t like a ton of highlighter , it would be a great option. For me I like to add a little bit of a powder highlight on top, a good one to pair with it is Tarte Stunner, as it’s a soft champagne pink tone. Anyway , if you love dewy glowy youthful skin , try this out. You can always apply a powder blush on top which I have done as well.

Long lasting.,"I’ve been using this product for several months and I’m absolutely in love with the way it warms up my face and adds a gorgeous glow. They’re cream products so they look best when you put in a little work when blending them out on your skin - I recommend using your fingers, especially for the highlight. The tropic equinox shades are beautiful on my medium/tan skin and the highlighter shade would look good on skin tones similar too & deeper than mine if you have deep skin and are curious — the “blush” shade however is more akin to a bronzer (superrr warm) and likely won’t work on dark/deep dark skin tones. Overall highly recommend this product, plus it’s nice that this is “clean beauty”. Go get you one if you’ve been thinking about it!!

I’m fairly pale skinned though and I can still make this work. You honestly need the bare minimum of product to get incredible payoff. I find my fingers are the best application tool. I find some cream cheek products seem to just sit on top of my skin and feel heavy. This is the perfect formula for a cream that delivers long wear and great pigmentation but feels light and looks like a natural flush. Next time I will probably just purchase the lower pigmentation version of this. For darker skin tones this would be a killer shade.

I prefer cream products for their natural finish and this product is very, very natural. Compared to other cream blushes and face colors I’ve used in the past, it’s one of the most smooth and blendable (most akin to RMS than, say, Stila). It doesn’t require any pulling at the skin and isn’t sticky, thanks to what feels like a low melting point (I also wouldn’t leave it in the car). Both the blush and highlight are mildly glossy, but not distractingly so, and the highlight is flattering even if it looks darker than your typical choice. I was uncertain choosing between Velvet Melon and its High Intensity counterpart. After using, I’m still just slightly unsure as the melon shade is nearly undetectable (and I’m a pretty pale person). If you like to add dimension by layering a more vibrant color to the apple of the cheek, this product provides a really good base and serves as a subtle, no-makeup product on other days. As someone who tends to be light-handed on the first pass but somehow always overdoes the second, I like this as a foolproof product for a natural look or paired with bold lips or eyes.

For reference, I have dry skin and am a MAC NC 25 - 30 depending on the season. The formula is creamy and so easy to blend. It provides a dewy finish. It doesn't last all day, but most cream blushes tend to wear off on me throughout the day. I would say that if you have a deeper skin tone, I would go with the high intensity version of this formula because on me, this regular version is very natural and kinda subtle. It may not show up on deeper skin tones.

Both sides apply and blend seamlessly, are pigmented without being overpowering, and last all day (even through a sweaty 80 degree day). You get a good amount of product in each shade as well. I am so impressed by this product. The only downside is the packaging: it has a mirror but it’s not as luxurious feeling as other similarly-priced items.

I’ve only had this for a few days so I’m hesitant to give it five stars, but I found it very easy to apply, the color was sheer and buildable (if that’s what you’re going for, I prefer more natural looks) and it stayed on perfectly throughout eight hours of going to a pumpkin patch with kids and running errands. I’m definitely going to buy the pink duo too!!

I think the hue takes a lot to build up and is almost veering on too orange (perhaps more so on me because I have reddish cheeks already). The formula for both the blush and highlight is great and if they sold the highlight as its own product, I'd def pick it up if I finished this one. The application and blending is easy wither its with a brush, sponge, or fingers (I recommend applying with fingers then blending out with a sponge). I'm interested in the bronzer duo and maybe even the other blush shade but I'll first try to use this up :)

I'm very fair with freckles, and I love adding a bit of natural warmth to my cheeks. I find I can actually pull off putting a bit on the lower section of my cheekbones and the high points of my face, and it looks extremely natural and flattering. I usually have to use two different products for that, but it somehow works here. The highlighter is also great, but not my favourite part of the duo. I love the blush enough that I'll give this 5 stars, but I was close to knocking off a star because of the product design. Kosas really needs to sell individuals; either pan replacements or solo products. I'm less inclined to buy another creme blush duo because I already have the highlighter, and when I run out of this blush there's no way I'll be out of the highlighter I already have. Kosas, please, you're getting an amazing brand following due to your wonderful products, but we need more versatility in the design in order to fully experience the line (and not feel bad about product waste).

The color looks very bright but you can blend it down to your own preference. I love it and wish it came in more colors. The highlighter is very subtle but you can build it up from super light to possibly medium coverage. If you want to be seen from the moon, this highlighter might not be for you. Lol. I also love that it doesn’t give that cake-y finish most other powder highlighters give. All in all, great product! Will buy again once I finish this.
