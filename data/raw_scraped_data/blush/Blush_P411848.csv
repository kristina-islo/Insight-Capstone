I was hoping it would be long-lasting for 8 hours or more and I hate doing touch ups. First time ever using a blush stick or cream. I am going to stick with my regular powdered blushes.

Goes on well and has a decent staying power for me (I do use a primer and foundation including ht Ilia liquid serum foundation). Usually use my fingers to put on cheeks. This particular color is great,a nice actual dusty rose, not very brown but a deep rose pink. A little shimmer but not a lot which is awesome because seriously I do not want a lot of shimmer. I am early 40's and not into to much shine/glitter anymore. This is a good color for me being fairly pale. Makes a perfect ""blushing"" color, it is buildable if want more flush to the cheek. Have not used on the lips. Have used as a base on eyes as well under some shadow to give some depth as well as to make the eyes more ""awake"" and not as pale when not using eyeshadow. Works great for that too.

I’m giving this product three stars because it has some pros and cons. Ilia is a great clean brand, I highly recommend them. However, I was hoping for more with this multi stick. Literally...more. The stick is pretty small for the price. And even though it will last forever, I was hoping to get more for my money. Beautiful color and pigmentation, but you wanna know the one thing I just can’t get past???? The smell. I only use this on my cheeks because the thought of using it on my lips kind of grossed me out because of the smell. It’s so chemical scented, there is absolutely nothing appealing about it. I’d have been happier if it had no scent at all. I didn’t expect it to be fruity or anything. Plus, when you put it on your lips it doesn’t moisturize, it simply tints. So plan on putting something on underneath. I don’t know, I wouldn’t invest in this until they change the formula... because that smell really makes it not worth it.

I am in my mid-30s and am a no-makeup makeup person. Very fair skin with cool undertones. Beautiful shade, gives the most natural flush and I love to apply the tiniest bit in my nose for a very natural look. Not long wearing but reapplies well. I apply about 4 little swipes on the apples of my cheeks and blend/pat in with my finger. If I’ve over-applied, I use my Real Techniques expert face brush to absorb the excess. Love this product and also apply to my lips then add a sheer gloss, like a Burt’s Bees in a light pink. Again, not long wearing BUT natural looking, beautiful/healthy finish and clean ingredients.

When I tried it on it looked just like what I was hoping to find, but unfortunately the lighting in the store distorts colors.and the next day in natural light, it had an orange cast to it. I wanted pink, but it isn't horribly orange and I apply a light layer of what's left of a (discontinued) pink-colored blush stick on top of it. This ILIA blush is very light and sheer and one application isn't enough to make much of a difference, so be prepared to use up more of it than you might expect. Plus it's a short little stubby stick, unlike other stick blushes I've purchased over the years, so you get far less product.

I like this product but prefer Bite beauty Multisticks for the versatility (cheek, eye, lip), color options, and color payoff.

blush,ILIA,ILIA Multi-Stick,zeloci,VIB,Rookie,"['Eye Color Brown', 'Hair color Brunette', 'Skin Tone Olive', 'Skin Type Combination']",4 stars,15 Aug 2019,no,,,natural dewy flush in a stick,"Dreamer is a great warm brownish rose that is easily blendable and buildable. I love how you can go from a sheer to bright flush and it leaves you perfectly dewy and not oily (and it doesn’t contain coconut oil, which I try to avoid on the face). Someone else said it leaves you “plump” and I concur! It seems to wear differently on the eyes, lips, and cheeks, so if you use it on all points, your face doesn’t look too washed with the same color. Smell is not the greatest but barely noticeable to me and worth it since it’s a “clean” product. Although it is on the pricier side, it really is a great size multi use product to throw in a bag for no fuss flush on the go. Packaging is sleek and sturdy.

The color is actually really nice and is one of the very few cream blushes that doesn’t have shimmer. But.... when they say it will give a dewy finish, what they mean is “you will look like you have been sweating for 3 days and haven’t washed your face.” This stuff is OILY. It felt like I was rubbing sticky overnight cream on my cheeks! And, oddly, I found the formula hard to blend. The pigment seemed to clump up in areas. Maybe because of the peach fuzz on my cheeks? Whatever the reason, this got returned immediately. My oily skin doesn’t need any help from this blush. I would have given only 1 star, but the color was really nice. Maybe if you have dry skin this could work for you.

Yes it is expensive, but I also do not cheap out on make up if I know it will not break me out or negatively affect my skin.
