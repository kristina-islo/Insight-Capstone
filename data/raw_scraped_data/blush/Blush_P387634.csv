They were sheer and natural looking, but also long lasting. Apparently Sephora doesn’t make those anymore, and I couldn’t find another liquid blush that seemed right, so I tried this. Definitely a higher price point, but I’ve been very happy with this in the “Plumped Up Peony” shade. It seems like a lot when it goes on, but it blends easily and looks very natural. I agree with some people that it doesn’t really last all day, but I don’t think it completely fades away either.

If I had time to put on only a single item, I would definitely choose this. The portability and ease of application can't be beat! For a doll-like cheek, add two hearts/dots of blush on the apples and blend out very gently with your fingers, or for a really subtle blush, add three dots going up toward your temple and blend upward. It's hard to make a mistake with this blush because of how creamy and blendable it is, but you can keep it highly pigmented too. $23 is a reasonable price; I've used this every day for 2 years and still have not run out. If you have warm-toned skin, robust rhubarb gives a healthy, natural coral-peach glow with just a hint of shimmer/sheen.

It's a rich color, easily blendable... the only ""weird"" thing about it is that after I apply two big dots to the apples of my cheeks (think Pogo the Clown dots), I then spread it with my fingers, as the stick doesn't apply natural-looking brush strokes. I don't think you could use a brush, either. I don't care too much, but... if you're putting on a full face of makeup, you definitely might mind.

However! Even though this product is pretty and goes on easy and blends well, it DOES NOT last. In fact, the only way to make it look like you are wearing blush after an hour or so is to put another blush on top-kind of defeating the point of low maint makeup. Anyway, I wouldn't recommend this-what's the point of putting on a blush if 1 hr later you can't even see its there?

I have a lot of bright berry colored stains that are very flattering on me but I think this one is my fave for a flattering everyday look. It blends well and is buildable but I don't need to much. Just gives my cheeks a glow and sheen that is so flattering. I don't find it hard to blend but it is best on recently exfoliated and freshly moisturized skin. Also, wouldn't recommend for those with very oily or very dry skin. Will try more colors.

The color was practically gone after 4 hours and it was just disappointing. This is NOT worth $23.

I wanted to give this a try mainly because it was the only shade of kind of soft plum that I really liked. When you smooth it on, it's very bright. Almost clown like. But blend it onto the apples of your cheeks, along the cheekbones and toward the hairline, and it turns into just the perfect pop of color. That's exactly what I was looking for. You can layer on more to amp up the impact, but I think it's a perfect product for an every day look. Just a little goes a long way. You can smooth it on lids and lips, too, but I don't do use it for that.

I was hesitant at first with buying something I'd never tried before, and even more so when I received it. I purchased the color '02 Robust Rhubarb' and was expecting a coral color. However, the color is much more pink than expected. It is sheen and gives off great color, it's also incredibly blendable which is what I love. But my cheeks are red enough as it is, and although the pink tones don't add to it, it was certainly a cause for concern since I didn't want to add redness. This product is good in terms of use and functionality, but the color doesn't correlate to the description.

I bought this about 8 months ago when I wanted something easy for my makeup on vacation to Hawaii. Since then, I have used this Chubby Stick in Peony EVERY DAY. It blends well, looks sheer, feels great. No adverse reactions (even with sweaty, humid weather and sunscreen). Huge amount of product. I usually apply this cream blush over foundation, then follow with powder and powder contour/blush/highlighter. However, you don't have to layer or make things complicated. It's fine to just apply, blend, and apply a little more if you want to take it up a notch. Peony is a great mauve-plum color and I think it looks very natural on my NC35 skin. It also shows up when I am tan (NC45), but I would apply more product. I wish Clinique made more adventurous colors, but I suppose that is part of their marketing strategy-- simplicity for women in a hurry. I will definitely repurchase when this runs out... someday. :)

First of all, I like that it comes in a stick vs. a regular pan. You still need to blend it with your fingers a bit, but you can apply it directly to your cheeks instead of having to dip your fingers in the product and then pat it on your cheeks. The wash of color is just right - not too dramatic but still noticeable. It blends really well and the color is build-able. This is the perfect blush to use on no makeup/minimal makeup days. I did not purchase this intending to use over foundation, setting powder, etc. so I cannot attest to if it moves the product underneath. It has no shimmer/glitter (unlike Nars The Multiple). It has no smell like some others I've tried (I'm looking at you Josie Maran and Tarte). It's not sticky/tacky feeling (again Tarte), nor is it greasy or shiny. It lasts just as long as any other regular blush. Best cream blush in my opinion.
