The reason I’ve been able to use this for so long is because it doesn’t make me breakout. In my early twenties when my skin was more unpredictable and I had more breakouts, it never aggravated my break-out prone skin. Now in my early 30’s I have slightly dryer skin and it doesn’t dry me out like other powders do. This bronzer is IT for me!!

Maybe there was a formulary problem with this batch but I will be returning it promptly. There is nothing sheer about this, I look as if someone slapped me across the face!
