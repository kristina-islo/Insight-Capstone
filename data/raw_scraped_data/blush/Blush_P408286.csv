But girl, it stops here. I’m buying my THIRD one (I have never done that with any other brand). The Luxe color gives this beautiful pop of salmon pink - (but still slightly natural) that I cannot find anywhere else. It’s also not a gloss or lipstick or cream look - it’s so unique that you literally have to try it to see what I’m talking about. The case is big enough to also include a gloss over it if you want an extra BAM in the evenings. Does not dry and stays put more than most lipsticks.

It is very comfortable to wear on the lips and I dot some on my cheeks too, blend it out, and it provides a wonderful flush w/out any sticky tacky feel. I tried several colors to see which could be a good blush and lip color for me, and I was shocked when it wound up being 'pulse' only because I have an incredibly hard time finding a lighter lip color that actually covers my lips as they are very pigmented. Lighter colors can also wash me out, but this one enhances and provides a semi-realistic glow. For reference I have medium-light neutral skin, and my lips at their deepest are almost mauvey-purple. Using it on the cheeks lasts a long time for a little amount of product, and on the lips it remains dewy/glossy, so it will wear off if you eat and drink during the day. I believe the deeper colors leave behind a stain, but pulse is too light for that kind of effect. The packaging is something I never particularly care for, but in this case it is extremely useful. You get the stick and also a separate sharpener, and in the lid of the tin you also get a magnifying mirror. The packaging has enough room to be used to house 2-3 items in your bag if you remove the sharpener. I have tried and purchased a couple nudestix products and find them to be amazing quality and they do not look like you are being worn by the makeup, but very much that you are enhancing your own natural beauty. Highly recommend this and wish I could give it bonus stars.

It's dark enough to wear out in all black, and pinky enough to look cute and professional during the day as well. Not to mention, it is the best texture of a lipstick I've worn in a long time. The gel is perfect! I can rub my lips together all I want without fear of it being too glossy and getting stringy, nor too matte and having the lipstick crumble. I can't wait to repurchase.

However, it requires constant reapplications throughout the day as it does not sit on the lips well and stay. A HUGE problem with this product is the ever increasing need then to reapply which requires that you resharpen the tip. For a product that costs over $20, it DOES NOT last long! No bang for the buck!! So much product is also wasted in the sharpening process. It's almost like the case is a big part of the cost (even though I must admit, I love the case!). It's a great produce, just not worth the price considering how little mileage you get on the usage compared with other lip sticks.

Wasteful packaging.,"I like this lipstick and this colour a lot, but I won't buy it again. First of all, you constantly have to sharpen it. And every time you do, you lose some lipstick to the edges of the sharpener. It's a waste. When I get to the end, I imagine I won't be able to use the last of it at all. As well, I really object to having to buy a new case and sharpener every single time I buy a product. It's not possible to get replacements on their own. How many cases and sharpeners does one person need? Not that many. It's just landfill and wasted money. So I will find another brand that has just as good a colour and product. There are lots of choices. Nudestix should consider revising their packaging to be less wasteful.

But if you want extra pigment and staying power I recommend getting the NUDESTIX Lip + Cheek Pencil in the shade Mystic. They pair perfectly together. They sharpen beautifully...in other words the consistency of the product isn't overly soft. I've finally found my go-to lip product. No more skinny, drying pencil liners that break or need frequent sharpenings. I'm super confident you will love my recommendations if you're looking for a gorgeous pigmented natural believable lip.

As for use on cheeks, I found that the product was way too sticky for me. It didn't blend out nicely with fingers or brush, and took a pretty damp beauty blender to get it to work on the cheeks even a little.

Great for a light nude look and more.,"Absolutely love the gel colour lip + cheek balm in Luxe. It's a wonderfully fresh pink colour that gives a nicely blushed cheek. The subtle shimmer of the gel really freshens my face and gives a beautiful glow. Definitely use the same colour on the lips as you do the cheeks, it really brings out those features. This is probably my favourite Nudestix product so far. For a light nude makeup routine I use the Luxe gel colour for lip/cheek, two different shades of their concealer pencils as foundation/contour, and light mascara. Makes me feel comfortable and beautiful in my own skin.

I can put it on my lips and cheeks without a mirror which is KEY. I love the moisture- it really is a balm, which is hard to find with great color that stays on. I recommend this to EVERYONE!

Nudestix #nudelipkit, a trio of three ""minis"" (read: short with the same amount as a full-size stick) in all three formulas, preempting the launch of the Gel Color Lip + Cheek Balm. Unlike the counterparts in Matte and whatever that regular formula is, the gel lip color is slippery and a bit shiny, truly embodying a highly pigmented balm. The color lasts and leaves behind a nice enough stain and it was the perfect transition from ""I'm wearing matte lipstick because I've got it together and it's daylight!"" and ""holy jeez it's midnight I need something comfortable and I need to still look good."" Whatever. I'll probably buy at least 3 of the full-size shades. This stuff is great. Nudstix needs the hype it deserves.

blush,NUDESTIX,NUDESTIX Gel Color Lip + Cheek Balm,JesMakeup,,,"['Age 45-54', 'Skin Tone Olive', 'Eye Color Blue']",5 stars,24 Apr 2016,no,,,Really like the color and control of a soft pencil,"I got Rebel which is a real pretty medium pink a little softer than bubblegum pink but definitely in that range. I like the pencil because you don't need a liner. It goes on the lips and cheeks well, looks real pretty on fair skin and wears longer than a lot of moisturizing lip products I have. Also, this did not dry out my lips at all. I got a matte pencil of theirs that was very drying but this went on smooth, evenly pigmented and left my lips soft with no drying out which is a hard find for me. I have very dry lips and always have to use moisturizing lip products during wear and after removal. I love the sharpener cap that comes in the tin to pop-on once it is needed. The sharpener does sharpen really well without to much waste when you use it. I hate wasting product so I use a small plastic pop top oil paint container for the pink removed from shavings to use on my cheeks so I add a small amount of an SPF BB cream since my cheeks need the most sun protection, on a side note I use BB because I don't wear foundation. But it can be done with anything from primer, moisturizer, even foundation. I usually prefer twist up pencils so there would be less waste but at the same time, twist ups also dry out and break easier so it works out saving it like I do because it is pretty as a blush color too. The only improvement I could see in this product line is to give a choice to buy just the pencil at a cheaper price as a refill. I like the case but when I like a color as well as Rebel and Whisper (matte pencil I use as bronzer) I would prefer to buy the pencil for a cheaper price than collect extra tins and sharpeners. Since they don't offer this I do reuse and add side labels with lipsticks and ""the look"" inside like; day red, evening red, pink nude, plum nude, etc. I also stuff with extra samples and give to friends just as a fun thing or pre-shop day. The tins are just to nice to just toss away. I'm sure I will find more crafty ways to reuse them but I would prefer the option to by the pencil itself for cheaper.
