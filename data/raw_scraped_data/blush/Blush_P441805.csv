Not only was it easier to blend, but it lasts a lot longer too!! I would dot my Stila cream blush on my cheeks with my finger at 7:30 am, and by noon it would have worn off.

I will say though, the shades online don't look anything like the actual color i.e naturally pretty is labeled as warm peach but it's definitely more of a pink color still very pretty for everyday but not what I was expecting so if you get a chance swatch them in store so you can see the actual shades. Other than that these blushes are great I would recommend them!
