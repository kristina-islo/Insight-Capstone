The Color Doesn't Work For Me,"The formula of this blush is beautiful. It is smooth and not too powdery. There is subtle sheen in the powders, so it doesn't look completely flat on cheeks.

It looks pretty cool toned in the pan, and that's why I purchased this. But on my cheeks it appears way too warm for my liking (I have medium olive skin tone). So I decided to return it.

As a fair skinned person, I had a lot of redness that I was trying to hide if anything and was happy with just a bronzer. But then I thought of giving blush another chance by using it in a smart way, by choosing something that suits me better. I've looked like a clown before, but I figured trying the new tan/sunburn look thing would be nice and you wouldn't be able to notice as much when I went naturally red. So according to many reviews what was appealing was the longevity (100% true, otherwise whats the point?) and the slight glow from the products (also 100% true) This colour seems like a bronzer online but in person its the perfect sunkissed colour and I think it is a flattering versatile shade for various skin tones. I have a million freckles and have decided to embrace them and now prefer to wear light to no coverage (maybe conceal blemishes and undereyes) and focus on my skin looking at smooth and natural looking/flawless as possible. NOW let me tell you why this is the best makeup product I have ever purchased. I wear this with and put mascara on and I look even better than if I were to cake on a bunch of makeup like I used to. Cause this adds the beautiful sunkissed pop of colour like I mentioned. It adds a natural looking highlight from it's shear glowiness. And lastly it contours my face somehow (a tad of bronziness). I've never seen anything like it nor loved a makeup product as much. Everyone says this but I really don't write reviews, I just had to share my new secret weapon.

Blend easily and lasts longer than any blush I’ve tried. Buildable & natural looking (not too matte or too shimmery). So happy with Dolly & Seychelles on my medium complexion! Can’t wait to buy another one. I never leave reviews but I’ll never buy another blush again. I was a die-hard for Milani baked blushes but those don’t last on the skin nearly as long as these. The product itself is quite small but you don’t need a lot; I’ve been using very consistently for 3 months and they still look new. Also think this is reasonably priced. Would love for Buxom to launch a palette of these!

It reminds me of the cheap makeup in the 90s where you would end up looking so overdone. If that is your vibe, you will love these. If you like blush to be very apparent from the first touch, this is your jam. I personally prefer a more delicate product that I can build up, that style appears the most lit-from-within for me and my preferences. I gave 4 stars because the quality of the product is nice, from the compact to the blendability. The color is WAY TOO STRONG for me but that is more my preference that a product defect, if that makes sense. I think the product is fine it is just not for me. I am even considering de-cluttering these at some point because of how little I use them. It is hard to rate products when you don't like them as a matter of taste rather than product short-comings.

I use two different shades, depending on the undertone of my makeup. I use Before Today—Dusty Mauve for pinkish days, and Waking Up—Warm Nude for peachy days. Problem was that in humid East Coast air, my blush didn’t last long. I don’t like to use primers on my face, so the color sort of slides off in the damp heat. I decided to use a powder blush along with Ilia’s Color Haze, to keep the color alive. Buxom Wanderlust, which is sort of a cream-to-powder blush, seemed like a good choice. I purchased the pinkish shade, Ibiza, and used it underneath the Ilia liquid pigment in a beautiful rosy mauve shade, Before Today. Wow! The effect is beautiful going on, and it doesn’t evaporate or melt down in the wet heat. This is because Buxom wisely infused this Wanderlust Blush with primer! Rather brilliant. Now I have dimensional, gorgeous color on my face, and it looks clean, smooth, and natural. Best of all, it’s blush that lasts!! It holds true for at least 6-8 hours before needing a little refresh. The Wanderlust Primer-Infused Blush lets me apply lovely, lasting color that stays put, without having to use primer on my entire face. Thanks to the good, ingenious people at Buxom for creating a cosmetic equation for gorgeous face color: Blush Infused Primer = Perfection.

This is the perfect slightly flushed, youthful color for my olive undertone and the texture is so smooth. I was initially concerned it would be shimmery or sparkly, but it just adds a nice radiance to my skin without emphasizing texture. Definitely can be built from sheer to as much color as you'd like.

I love that it's a blush you can build up for an extra glam look or make it look super natural. I'm personally not a blush fan myself, but whenever I wear it looks so natural I often get complements that my face is glowing. It's a must have and at only 27 it's a pretty good price. You can't go wrong. I think I'll pick up Mykonos next and this is coming from someone who doesn't really like blush.
