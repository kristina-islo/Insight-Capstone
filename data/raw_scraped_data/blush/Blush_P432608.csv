It has quickly become my favorite cheek product. I have been using it for about 7 months now, and it is all I ever want to use. It is super easy to blend out, it does not pick up the foundation or bronzer under it, and it lasts an extremely long time on my skin. It is also worth noting that the size of the product and the applicator make it super easy for touch ups on the go, which is great for people like me that do their makeup on the way into the office in the morning.

Worth it.,"I’m floored. At 40 years old I’m looking for exceptional products that allow me to wear less makeup overall, rather than loading my face with more in an attempt to recapture youth. Although I was unsure which shade to buy, I’m extremely pleased with 53/Red. For reference, my skin tone is light/warm with yellow undertones. What makes this blush special is how effortlessly it blends into the skin. I’m not sure how it would work for someone who wears full-coverage foundation. I use a light spray of Dior Airflash. This delicate, creamy rouge is perfectly distributed by one fingertip and leaves me with a totally natural looking flush. Have you ever caught yourself in the mirror after walking outside on a cold day and really liked the rosy hue of your cheeks? That’s what this does. It simply doesn’t look or feel like makeup. When I first applied it I wasn’t wearing any foundation. It made me look so healthy and bright, I didn’t feel the need to wear foundation at all. For a self-conscious 40 year-old woman, THAT is what good makeup is all about. I’m very selective about the makeup I buy. I’ve never labeled anything a “holy grail” item besides Dior Airflash because there’s nothing else like it on the market. For me, this blush is that good. After the first use I decided it was a non-negotiable staple and absolutely worth the price. No other brand’s formulation can compete with its quality. THAT is a HG product. Here’s hoping they broaden the color selection.

I've been just dipping a q-tip into the container and not using the wand, but finally gave up because of the difficulty of then putting the product on my face. The blush itself is a very nice color but I won't buy it again until they change the packaging. In the meantime I've just thrown this away.

I initially purchased them at a Department Store, but was ecstatically stoked when they appeared on Sephora's shelf - BEST LIQUID BLUSH HANDS DOWN. It has a consistent pigmented texture and blends in smoothly with a moist sponge. 2-5 dabs on each cheek does the trick, depending on the level of ""blush flush"" you're going for. I love color 50 for an everyday day-time use and go up to color 54 for an evening or more sultry vibe. Anyways, IN LOVE! Got a bunch for my friends to experience too :)

This is the only liquid blush that I can dab directly on my cheek-then blend out. The others that I use regularly (Nars, Glossier, Flower Beauty) I spread on the back of my hand and then apply with a brush and tap out any edges with my fingers or a sponge.
