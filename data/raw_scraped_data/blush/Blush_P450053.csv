The blushes are SUPER pigmented so make sure you use a light hand but they look gorgeous on the skin. The formula is creamy and does not cake up on the skin or transfer throughout the day. I have light skin and ALL of the colors look flattering on me and mix well with one another. The highlighter is gorgeous but definitely contains glitter which I like but I know some people don't!

Not as pigmented as I expected, but they blend and build up nicely. I prefer it that way, because superpigmented blushes can be harder for me to work with than ones that I can gradually build up, but I can see this as not being great for darker skin tones.
