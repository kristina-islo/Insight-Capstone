blush,BAREMINERALS,bareMinerals BOUNCE & BLUR Blush,Dimensions,Rouge,Rookie,"['Eye Color Brown', 'Hair color Red', 'Skin Tone Light', 'Skin Type Normal']",5 stars,9 d ago,no,Color: Blurred Buff,https://www.sephora.com/productimages/sku/s2250199+sw.jpg,Everyday Blush,"I feel like more people should be talking about these! The formula is so unique. I love cream products and this is kind of a putty texture that goes on like a cream, but dries down so there is no sticky feeling (which I hate). I completely agree with the blurring claim. It’s such a soft focus kind of finish. I use a dense brush to stipple it on first, then use circular motions to blend it out. Also, this Blurred Buff color is a dupe (in color) for Glossier’s cloud paint in Dusk. But, this is great because sometimes I don’t want to mess with a liquid product. On my cool, fair complexion, this rosy bronze shade works perfectly as a bronzer/blush hybrid for no makeup, makeup days. I feel like I need to order a backup in case it gets discontinued. So good!

Also like that because the formula is so soft it can be easily applied with either a brush or your fingers. Pigmentation is also pretty good. I would recommend.

The texture is smooth and extremely easy to apply. The color is very vibrant and not very forgiving if you apply too heavy the first time. Compared to the bounce and blur eyeshadow the blush doesn’t “blur” as much. If you are very careful when applying you will be fine but if you over do it the pigment is hard to blend or lighten. The color lasts all day and you can create softer touches of color or bolder defined cheekbones with the same blush. I like the product and will continue to use it but I wish the color was a little more forgiving for such a vibrant tone. This review was written in return for complimentary testing of the product.

Gives a ice healthy flush to the skin. Like the bounce and blur eyeshadows, this product is great for no makeup/subtle looks. Don’t expect a great color payoff here.",0,0,Recommends this product

I’m not. I did find after playing around for a bit it was a little easier to use. I found that applying it first to the back of my hand and then going to applying on my cheeks seem to disburse the product more evenly. Are used my fingers at first to apply and then went over it with a beauty blender. I received this product complementary in exchange for my honest review.

Creamy texture and nicely pigmented. The color blends well with my contour. The application is best when you use your fingers but I prefer brush application. I haven't found a brush that picks up the creamy texture yet. When I use my finger to apply, I feel that it doesn't move once its laid down onto skin which can be a pro and con. Con because it can leave spots that are darker than intended, don't be to heavy handed. Pro because this blush stays all night long. Over all, I love the texture, color and long lasting wear. Might try the other shades for fun! This product was received complimentary of Influenster for testing and review purpose! Example picture attached. I received this product complimentary for review purposes. Pro tip: Blush is important to add some color to your face, blend your blush to the top of your jaw contour, let those colors touch but CAUTION with this specific blush, it won't budge if you put too much on.

It went really well with my olive skin tone and it went on really smoothly. I used a brush to apply and I liked that the color stayed only on the area I applied it to. It was very true to color and lasted all day. My mom also borrowed it for a wedding and said she got lots of compliments. We have different skin tones and the color looked great on both of us. It felt light on our skin and I felt like my pores could still breathe with it on. Definitely recommend this color from Bare Minerals. Thanks Influenster and Bare Minerals for letting me try this blush for free!
