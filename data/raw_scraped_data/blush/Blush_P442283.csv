I love the versatility it offers! You can use it on your eyes, cheeks and lips for a simple, yet beautiful and on-trend look. The formula applies easily and feels smooth and luxurious while having adequate/buildable pigmentation that doesn’t emphasize texture. Unfortunately, the shade I was sent (Haute Couture) isn’t exactly a winner on my fair, cool-toned skin when applied on my lips and cheeks. It has an orangey base that would look gorgeous on someone warmer-toned than me! I suggest using an eyelid primer before applying it as an eyeshadow to prevent creasing. This was my favorite way to wear Le Monochromatique! The packaging looks like what you’d expect from Lancôme, but I dislike the bulkiness of it. The extra space in the lid seems unnecessary and makes what a is supposed to be a portable product less portable! Overall, I could definitely see myself purchasing this product in another shade and recommend it to anyone who wants a multi-use makeup product that allows them to pull a look together quickly.

Also a great eyeshadow if you’re traveling and want to bring a 2-in-1 product that can be used on the go!

Its not long lasting as a lip product but it works great for touch ups, minimal makeup days, or to keep as a compact if you want a fast splash of color.
