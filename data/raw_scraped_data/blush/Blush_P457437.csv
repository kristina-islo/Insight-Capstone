blush,SEPHORA COLLECTION,SEPHORA COLLECTION Color Flush Lip And Cheek Stick Set,rrrrrrrrrrrrr,Insider,Rookie,"['Eye Color Blue', 'Hair color Brunette', 'Skin Tone Fair', 'Skin Type Combination']",4 stars,21 d ago,no,,,,Reminiscent of the old Tarte cheek stain which I was obsessed with.

blush,SEPHORA COLLECTION,SEPHORA COLLECTION Color Flush Lip And Cheek Stick Set,Mirano,Insider,Rookie,"['Eye Color Hazel', 'Hair color Brunette', 'Skin Tone Light', 'Skin Type Combination']",5 stars,26 d ago,no,,,CUTE AS LIP TINT :),"I love to wear these as natural lip tint/balm. They are very glossy, I wouldn’t wear it on my cheeks unless I needed a waterproof blush. At first I was skeptical, but I ended up loving both the colors, the coral is more of a pink with a peachy tint. They are bigger than the regular lip-balm size so they aren’t as convenient for traveling/purses.",0,0,Recommends this product

While I was aware it was sheer, the dewiness is a grease that eventually separates, wears away, and just looks shiny. It works very well as a chapstick and color was cute in pink, not so much in orange. All in all the value didn't fit the bill so I'm returning.",9,2,

It is a sheer wash of color and imparts a slight stain on your lips when it wears off. It gives the cheeks a youthful glow. More natural looking, not intense color. I love it!",18,0,Recommends this product

BUT it is essentially a gloss stick with very little pigment. It's 50/50 to me.",14,2,
