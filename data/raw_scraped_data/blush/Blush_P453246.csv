Absolutely detest the top row of gel to powder highlights as these do not pick up with the brush. even with my fingers, I have to go in strong and it already feels like it has developed hard pan - I just bought it! Blushes too have hardly any pigmentation. Waste of my money. Compare this with the Too Faced Naturals face palette, and that palette is a DREAM.

If you are intimidated by blush this will work for you. I also bought this for my mother who has rosacea and does not like a traditional blush because of that. She also really enjoys this. I personally use the highlighters as a blush topper because I prefer a more distinct highlighter but if you prefer a more ""lit from within"" kind of highlighter you will enjoy this.",2,1,Recommends this product

It’s ok. The creamy texture shades are harder to apply. They don’t pick up on the brush, tried sponges and fingers. Fingers worked best but still not great. Thought it would be a great travel pallette. But not really worth the effort when I have better NARS products. I have a light complexion as well so I’m surprised that it takes a heavier hand on those. I’m used to being light handed.

blush,NARS,NARS Afterglow Overlust Cheek Palette,Car9L,,,"['Eye Color Brown', 'Hair color Black', 'Skin Tone Tan', 'Skin Type Combination']",5 stars,28 d ago,no,,,$60 for the price of 2+4 blushes!!,"Beautiful colors. Just because the colors aren’t suitable for your skin tone or the fact that it’s not the most pigmented blush formula, doesn’t deny the fact that this product itself is an amazing product. The highlighter aren’t blinding. They’re more of a powder/ creamy formula so using your fingers will be a better option rather than using a brush. They’re more of a blush topper. The blushes are so finely meld. However the colors are natural and soft so it might not show up as well on deeper skin tones. I understand the controversies people have on this pallet. Some people might say that it doesn’t have enough payoff, but to me, the payoff is just enough and it’s so easy to blend bc it’s so buttery. I prefer blushes that aren’t too pigmented bc then it won’t be too much all at once. If anything, just build it up. Also, you’re paying $60 for 6 colors when NARS blushes are $30 EACH. So if you like two of the colors in this limited edition pallet, it’s worth it right?

The highlighters are a unique formula that I found myself to love. For my skintone I can only use the first light shade and I LOVE the glow it gives. Not blinding but a soft romantic glow. Best when applied with a finger. The other highlighter shades I can also use as blush toppers for a dewy look. This is the BEST cheek palette I own!

You’d think they couldn’t come up with anything new, but this is! Admittedly the highlighters look pretty much the same on me (light, neutral/yellow skintone), but the blushes are all very distinct. I haven’t seen a blush palette with muted tones that didn’t look a bit chalky or ashy until this one! These are great for looks where the blush isn’t the Star, but you don’t necessarily want to use a harsh contour shade to define your cheeks.

At this point are we really surprised that this brand has released yet another completely versatile, user friendly and amazing palette. Nars Orgasm started this frenzy among makeup geeks everywhere, and companies have duped it over and over again, and since nars has released multiple successful launches, but they've managed to outdo themselves, once again by introducing their gel to powder formula. This highlighter formula is absolutely stunning, and the best part, anyone can use them, regardless of their makeup skill or their specific taste. The colours are extremely pigmented on the first swatch, but don't seem to pigmented on application, this doesn't make it a bad product in fact it makes it a great one. The new gel to powder formula look stunning, you can go for a subtle application for just a bit of a dewy radiance on the high points of your face or get them to look super intense and blinding. Bear in mind that these highlighters are gel to powder, they do need to be warmed up a little when you first start to use this palette, just use your fingers to get the product to warm up, and become a little loose from its press. Once you get it going these colours all perform beautifully, and the best part about the new highlighter formula is that it doesn't look powdery, and for the oily girls out there since it dries down to a powder it will stay in place all day with being set. its the best of both worlds, and in my opinion is worth the hefty $78 price tag

blush,NARS,NARS Afterglow Overlust Cheek Palette,atomicvelvet,VIB,Rookie,"['Eye Color Hazel', 'Hair color Blonde', 'Skin Tone Medium', 'Skin Type Combination']",3 stars,21 Jan 2020,yes,,,Not the easiest to work with,"I go back and forth with this palette. My skin is a light medium shade with neutral to warm undertones (NC25 if we're going there), so I feel like I shouldn't have an issue with these shades. Some days, if I apply the highlight with a damp sponge, it does look like a beautiful dewy glow. However, I have not been able to pick the highlight up on a brush, and if I apply it on a lighter ""no-makeup"" day, it can be a visible streak of product. If you are a lighter skintone than I am, I'm not sure how you could make all the shades work. The texture and feel of the blushes is very nice. They are by no means powdery, and they have a slight luminosity with no visible shimmer particles. My issue is that only the far right shade really shows up on my skin, and I don't feel like it's special enough within my collection to justify keeping this palette. With the left and middle blush being too light for me, it's like the opposite issue than the highlighter shades. I think I have to call this a miss for me. I was so excited for these tones... I love cream highlights, and wanted a few new glowy-ish blushes. Although a beautiful result is possible, in the long run I don't think I'll reach for this so I'm gonna return it while I still can.

I find the powder sits really nicely and the two products meld together well. If you like blinding/wet highlighter, this is not the product for you.

Great for fair skin!,"Gets 4.5 stars from me!! It's so hard for me to find a blush I like because of how fair my skin and features are (red hair, blue eyes). All three shades are perfect, and just slightly more subtle than my go to ""Dolce Vita"" of their regular blush. I really like the versatility of the highlighters and many highlighters are either too golden or too pink for my undertone. These are all great, my only critique would be that they lack a little bit of intensity that other highlighters offer, but still are nice and pigmented with shimmer. I tried all of these in store, and this is on my list to buy!

The highlights are best applied with a beauty blender..I personally got them to work with an abh highlight brush and the highlights are so stunning!!,12,1,Recommends this product
blush,NARS,NARS Afterglow Overlust Cheek Palette,Manders666,VIB,Rookie,[],4 stars,26 Dec 2019,no,,,beautiful,"I have a zillion blush pallets but found this one and had to have it. The blush is an interesting formula...it’s almost creamy, but not. The reason I’m giving 4 stars is because you really need to dig your brush in the color over and over to get any on the brush. This is only true with the shimmer colors, whereas the color payoff on the matte colors is easy to apply.",13,3,Recommends this product

blush,NARS,NARS Afterglow Overlust Cheek Palette,zalelunata,VIB,Rookie,"['Eye Color Green', 'Hair color Blonde', 'Skin Tone Fair', 'Skin Type Combination']",2 stars,24 Dec 2019,yes,,,"Okay blushes, horrible highlighter formula","I generally hate blush as I'm always in a constant battle to find some that works for my fair skin. I feel like anything I put on instantly looks way to bright; most often I use light bronzers as blush. I saw one video review that suggested this palette was more suited for fair skin tones, so I was intrigued. This is my first Nars purchase. I don't mind the blushes and I can see myself using them. The problem is the highlighters. They are impossible to apply using a brush. Using your finger to apply them gives them a much more intense, almost metallic highlighter look to them, and that is not something I want for everyday use. This palette is going back, I can't justify the price for 3 highlighters that are practically un-useable.

blush,NARS,NARS Afterglow Overlust Cheek Palette,luv143,Rouge,Rookie,"['Eye Color Hazel', 'Hair color Brunette', 'Skin Tone Light', 'Skin Type Oily']",4 stars,21 Dec 2019,no,,,,I'm not a huge nars fan. So I was skeptical but I do actually enjoy this palette. I still think it's over priced but just rating the product itself... It's good. It's not a flat matte powder. It has somewhat of a creamy luminous (not glittery more like lit from within) glow. I have oily skin and I don't find it to be too dewy. Blends effortlessly. It'll take some building up if you want an intense blush color.,30,8,Recommends this product
