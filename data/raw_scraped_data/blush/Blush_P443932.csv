blush,TOM FORD,TOM FORD Lip Blush,Touni,Rouge,Rookie,"['Eye Color Green', 'Hair color Blonde', 'Skin Tone Light', 'Skin Type Oily']",5 stars,23 Apr 2020,yes,,,Love this lip balm!,"At this price point ur mainly paying for the brand name but Wow I love this product it’s amazing on my lips. The packaging is so so beautiful, mirror like and heavy just like I expect in a lux house. The gold flakes look stunning. My lips are moisturized a slight color change too very light pink on my lips to match my natural lip color but just enhanced. Not to much color the way I like. So for me this definitely worth it and worth 5 stars. Will definitely be buying backup just incense this is limited. You can buy similar lip balms for a fraction of the price. But I love my lux! Very happy.

blush,TOM FORD,TOM FORD Lip Blush,RNGesusPls,VIB,Rookie,"['Eye Color Brown', 'Hair color Black', 'Skin Tone Light', 'Skin Type Combination']",4 stars,10 May 2019,no,,,,"Enhances the natural pink color of my lips, like how they look after eating a spicy meal. The lip balm is slightly greasy but moisturizing and has no scent or taste. The moisturizing aspect isn’t long-lasting but it does leaves a subtle stain once it wears off. The product very smoothly swipes onto the lips with no tugging and I don’t unscrew it all the way to the top, so I haven’t experienced any breakage. The packaging is beautiful and sturdy. I attached some photos of the swatch alone and on the right side of my lips (left side of photo). This color-changing lip balm works as intended.

Back in Asia when I was little, similar products were being sold for a couple bucks each, and honestly no one buys them anymore lol for some strange reason, it became a hype years later over here? Lol The material itself may look cute but it’s seriously cheap, and I doubt that it has any benefits to your lips. I’ve tried this on in Holts when it first came out, and nope, you can barely notice the gold glitter in there LOL why anyone would spend $70 on this is beyond me.

It's not terrible, but that's really the best I can say about it. It's expensive for what it is; you're paying for the brand name, the gilded packaging, and the flecks of gold... that are there for now reason? Moisturizing: not great. It felt ok going on, but I faded away quickly. Color: Darker on me than the Dior Addict but not by much. Packaging: It's nice but not a reason to get it. Purchase Again? No, definitely not.

It was not moisturizing on my lips and it didn’t add any tint to my lips. It just felt like chicken grease on my lips. This product isn’t even worth half of the price and I’m a Tom Ford fan. The flecks of gold also wasn’t as much as they advertise. This is going straight back to Sephora ASAP!,66,7,

blush,TOM FORD,TOM FORD Lip Blush,,,,"['Eye Color Blue', 'Hair color Blonde', 'Skin Tone Medium', 'Skin Type Combination']",1 star,5 Apr 2019,no,,,SAVE your cash!!! Not TOM FORD Quality at all!!!,"REALLY!? What's happening with the Tom Ford Brand INWHICH WE ALL LOVE??? This product was first introduced from a Korean Brand which Also had a Clear Gel Lip Color which would Turn Pink Also. However, Remember how in the Korean Brand there was a Dry Flower!!! I Don't Understand Why Tom Ford would Sell Something SO CHEAPLY MADE!!!(While STILL CHARGING A HEFTY PRICE FOR IT!!!) This Product is Honestly TACKY!!! (And I Mean Tacky as in Cheap and Dollar Store Find!!!) Not TOM FORD AT ALL!!! But as for the actual Product, the Gel does glide on but will fade Completely OFF after you lick your lips, or sip on a drink!!! I WONT Even consider this as a lip Balm!! Or Even a Topper for Extra Shine, because Its Gone within Seconds unfortunately!!! Prettier in person though. The photo Does Not do it Justice. However, Save Your Cash for a Real Tom Ford Product!!! I can understand the fact that they wanted a tie on sale for the Gold Body Shimmer. But this wasn't the way to go Tom!!!
