Nothing was broken or anything like that but it still left a bit of a bad first impression. Also another thing I noticed right away was that hoola and dallas looked like different shades altogether. Both are lighter and seem less pigmented than either my standalone or the one in my cheekleaders palette. As for Georgia and Sugarbomb, well Georgia looks so pretty on my fair complexion. It comes off more as a slight peach glow than most of my other blushes in the same shade range. Sugarbomb though, I could take or leave. I just sorta feel meh about it, While cookie is the same as it always was.

I do however notice a difference in the Dallas and Hoola shades. I have had both as individuals and the shades in this palette are way lighter to me than the originals, especially Dallas. Dallas used to be my HG for years back in the day, so I was pretty excited it was in here. But it’s just not the same. It’s way lighter to me. Still good though!

It's huge, you get a ton of product in each pan and it's freaking adorable. However.. while I will be using some of these colors very frequently (OMG cookie! wow) some of the other colors were a bit darker than I expected (Dallas is darker/redder in person). I'm very fair toned and I think maybe they should have done 3 different pallets.. this one specifically would be perfection for someone in the mid-toned range, but having an option for a lighter and darker skinned person also would have made this a home run. Just my personal opinion. I still love it and will use it, I'm just hoping for something else similar in my shade range in the future.

I'm writing this review on behalf of everyone who was left out of this launch. It took Benefit YEARS to expand their bronzer shades only to not put them in ANY of the face palettes. That's why this is one star. If you're darker than a brown paper bag, save your coin and check out a brand that was inclusive BEFORE it was a trend. Even the brown skin woman on the packaging can't use this face palette LOL. This is a complete joke.

I am really glad I picked it up. These shades are smoothing and look wonderful mixed and solitary on the face. In the included picture I am wearing all the shades. Georgia, Dallas and sugarbomb do have a slight shimmer to them but it's more like a satin glow on the cheeks and it's very flattering and doesn't exaggerate texture. I like to use the shade Dallas as a bronzer topper on top of the hoola matte bronzer. Cookie is a gorgeous highlighter and really is blinding but can be sheared down a bit. I personally love it. i have also found that it doesn't emphasize my fine lines which i have on the tops of my cheeks from smiling. This is honestly a good deal for the big palette considering your getting full size products. All in all, a good buy and great to travel with as well.

Missing a star because brush is a waste, bristles are too rough for application, I prefer a round buffer brush. They should just add another new shade, like another highlighter or hula lite and up the price a little bit so you get even more product to like 75$ (even though it’s already a killer deal!!!) just a thought!! The multi shade blush, is SO beautiful! Also the smell isn’t too strong, it’s enough to smell on the face, for the first few minutes after it’s applied but not too strong... personally I love the fruity smell of these palettes, especially this one! Because it’s more peachy, and so yummmmy! Way to go benefit, you killed this! My new go-to!!
