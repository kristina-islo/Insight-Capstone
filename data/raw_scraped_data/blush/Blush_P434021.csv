And this gives me exactly that! <3 it gives me a very natural looking glow. I thought it is a completely matte blush but it actually got some very fine shimmer particle in it. But it’s very fine and not very noticeable. So you would still want highlight on top of it. For the quality of the powder, I had very high Expectation since everybody rave about it. I thought it was just alright since it’s a bit powdery (using RT brush) so I deduct one star despite how much I love both shades. My favorite blush is still the Laura mercier powder infusion.

I am blush obsessed and own an embarrassing amount. Yet most sit untouched because I can't stop using this one Jouer duo. It is perfect. The lighter side is the most beautiful matte cool toned pale pink. I don't know if it will work for skin tones darker than medium, but if you are in the fair to medium range I can not stress enough how gorgeous this shade is on the skin...like the natural kind of flush you would get if a naked Chris Hemsworth was standing in front of you with open arms and a wicked smile. The deeper shade is a gorgeous matte cool tone berry and it is quite pigmented and can built up for a variety of skin tones. This one looks beautiful on the skin as well. They are look great mixed, but I usually wear one on the cheekbones and the other on my apples for a pop of color. I saw that some other people had some issues with their duos cracking. I've had this one for over a year and I literally don't leave home without it and it's held up fine. And I'm not particularly careful with it either. My packaging has not peeled like others have as well. Besides the dent I've put in it, it looks just as good as when I got it. My sister spied it in my tote bag o' makeup not too long ago and oohed and ahhed over it when she was putting it on. Since I often pass makeup on when I'm not using it or don't love it she asked if it was something I was attached to and I had to fight the sudden urge to scratch her eyes out. I ended up screaming NO, snatched it out of her greedy hands, and cradled it to my breasts while she looked at me like I was crazy. And that's how much I love this Jouer blush duo. Hard and irrationally and I can't live without it.

It's got an awesome formula that blends effortlessly but never looks like too much. I'm extremely pale and freckled, and when I mix the two shades it's my perfect nude blush. Unfortunately, the blush just breaks too easily. After everyday use for almost a year, my first Adore duo started cracking (just on the Adore side- left side). It fell apart when I was traveling one day (I only ever keep it in my backpack so no one is throwing it around in the hold on planes). Half of it dropped when I opened it so I ordered a new one. Within 2 months of having the new one, Adore cracked AGAIN. I re-pressed it, and it held up for a week, but as soon as I traveled with it it started to crumble. I am so bummed because this is my favorite nude blush ever, but I can't keep shelling out $30 for it to have it break within a few weeks. Maybe if you never travel or take it with you on nights out, it would hold up fine, but that's just not practical for my lifestyle. Wouldn't recommend if you're a person on the go. I'll be finding an alternative to replace it.

You get two pigmented shades that are super blend-able and look great paired together. The lighter shade is fairly light so I can see it not showing up if you have darker skin tones. The product has not broken me out at all, and it is a natural colour which I wear daily to work. The packaging is beautiful and a light hand is all you need for a pop of colour.

Unfortunately, this product was a definite fail, for me. In the pan, swatched on the back of my hand and arm, this had a rosy hue (as suggested in the name Rose Gold). I fully am aware that the description mentions a peachy glow, however...on my face today, it pulled some serious orange. Kind of bizarre. Not remotely rosy OR peachy, but orange. It is very pigmented, which would be WONDERFUL if the color is right for you! It was a big drawback in my situation, because I generally “over do” my blush a bit, so I can then blend/buff it down with translucent loose powder. This blush really did not want to blend out though.

I wanted this blush for so long because of the very bright warm pink color, only to find out it is no where near as bright in person. What is the difference between this and a 5$ walmart blush? The color is much lighter/less bright in person, and not only that, but to get any decent color pay off on my medium skin tone I have to apply quite a bit. The lighter color doesn't show up AT ALL. What is it? a very useless highlighter? It takes a while for this to show up on me and aside from the gorgeous packaging it's useless for me. I am returning in the hopes of trying maybe the Laura Mercier blush... This might work if you are like German or Swedish super pale but not if you have any darker ethnicity whatsoever.

I usually blend them together. When I first opened it, I thought I was going to be disappointed with the colour but not at all. Very natural blush. I'm ordering again because I came to find it to show my Mom and it was gone. I'm not taking my chances of something being gone... grabbing it now.",0,0,Recommends this product

I bought this blush before Christmas. I have blushes from every high-end and drug store brand and it out performs all of them. Usually I have to reapply a blush every 3 hours. This blush outlasts all of them! It will stay looking good for an entire event. I highly recommend it over any brand out there right now. I'm back to buy all of their colors!,0,0,Recommends this product

Beautiful colours, pigmentation and they blend very easily. I did take off one star as I’ve only owned the palette for approximately 2 weeks and the lighter colour completely fell out of the case and broke in pieces on the floor. I keep all my makeup stored very well so I was really surprised when it just came out. Sadly I only used the colour a handful of times. Would definitely repurchase but be veeery careful when opening;)

The packaging is pretty, too, if you care about that sort of thing. The price isn't too bad. I will take away two stars because these really need to be sold separately. The darker shade is not for me, but I love, love, love the lighter one. It's gorgeous. BUT, I won't buy it again, because it is a waste for me since I only like one. Bad business decision.",0,0,
