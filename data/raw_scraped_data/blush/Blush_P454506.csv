It’s a good product, very pigmented and blends effortlessly which is great. Packaging is stunning and lux. Beautiful. However the colour is generic imo but I do like the outer ring the best. Wish the entire pan was that colour. Also, I did not expect that much kick up from a product at this price range. Reminds me of Colourpop’s pressed blushes. Definitely returning this but I will try this range in another shade.

I attached a photo in natural light of how it really looks. It gives a real nice glow and a subtle hint of rosiness to the cheeks. I really like it

Pillow talk is definitely a subtle everyday, nude color on my med-tan (NC37-40) skin. it is a very fine powder and goes on very smooth and gives a lovely healthy glow. I am not one for extreme sheen and glitter on my face. Being of a ""certain age"" this is great for mature skin and does not exaggerate texture on the skin. The only con for me is having the light color in the center for highlighting or blending edges. I would prefer the lighter color be separated on one side to allow the brush fit in the darker blush color similar to the ND blushes. I would purchase this color again and most likely purchase one of the other colors. Definitely worth the splurge during Sephora's sales.

I have a pretty big blush collection, and it’s easy for me to forget what I own if I don’t have it in front of me. Anyway, I love how natural these blushes look on me — I have Pillow Talk and Ecstasy. I rarely ever use them the way they were intended to be, which is by using the outer, larger ring as your main blush color and using the inner circle to either deepen your cheeks or to highlight (depending on which blush in the collection you own). Most blush brushes are too big to do that, so I just swirl both shades in the compact and use them as one color. Speaking of the compact, I find it very stylish and just the right size for keeping in a purse. It’s not as sturdy as I’d like considering the price of Tilbury products, but it’s not super weak and flimsy either. Overall, I recommend these for sure.

If you like pigmented blushes then this might not be your cup of tea. Also with the amount of pigmentation it has, I have a feeling it won’t really work as blush for darker skin tones. Might work as more of a highlight or blush topper since it’s super glow-y though.

My first impression about most of the blushes I saw on display was that the colors did not look at all like the online pictures. Some were so light looking that I mistook it for face powder. I wanted ecstasy but it looked so pale and chalky. I decided on Pillowtalk and yes, its more brownish looking but still nice. It goes well mixed with my bronzer. I like the nude-ish type of color instead of my usual coral blush. Like another reviewer said, at first I had to adjust to this type of color but after some uses, I came to like it alot. Minus one star since the highlighter in the middle makes it really hard to avoid it if I am using a thicker brush. If alot of highlighter is on the brush, it can emphasize my pores on the cheek.

Nothing special. The packaging was disappointingly cheap looking in person. I fell for the hype on this one. It’s hard to just use the matte, and it kind of oxidizes orangey on me later in the day.

I like the blush color for fair to even medium skin tones. I am fair and it almost makes me look like I have a flushed but subtle tan. This imparts sheer color, so is well suited for a beginner as it would be harder to over-apply compared to other highly pigmented blushes. The highlight color is very subtle, and again good for mature folks who don't want a blinding stripe or flecks of glitter on their face. On my fair skin and over the blush, the highlight shifts very slightly gold or champagne, but is not too dark. If one does try to build up the highlight, they may instead see a gold powdery area instead of an amped-up glow. I feel this could probably be duped with less expensive blush colors from many lines, and the subtlety of the highlight may frustrate many who like to wear a highlighter. On me, this duo imparted a nice, healthy sheer radiance rather than a dewy glow. Sort of like the difference between a matte and satin or slightly dewy foundation. No wet looks or sparkle here. That being said, I think I paid too much for this because it's in the CT line. I knew this going in, but feel I've obtained better values in other less pricey products for the performance.

So far I love this blush almost more than NARS. This color in particular is so different than anything I’ve bought (and that’s a lot). Good for olive/light to medium complexion. The highlight in the middle is great to use alone or to swirl with the blush! I’m sure any of these blushes are worth trying!,0,0,Recommends this product

The packing is so beautiful and luxurious! It’s maroon and rose gold, Charlotte’s signature colors. The blush is so finely milled that a little goes a long way. It gives hour cheeks a beautiful glow and flush of color at the same time. I’ve never had that experience with a blush! I love the champagne pop of glow in the middle of the blush. You have the option to swirl the two together or use the outer ring first and then the center for a pop of color! This will definitely last me a long time because you need very little product to get a beautiful blush of color on your cheeks. This shade is super gorgeous on my medium skin tone and could work for almost anyone. I absolutely love how universal Charlotte’s shades are!
