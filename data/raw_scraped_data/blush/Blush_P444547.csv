The formula is nice and soft, I find that I barely have to touch my brush to the product in order to get some nice pigmentation. The effect is glowy rather than too sparkly, as the shimmer is finely milled. I have a medium/fair olive skintone and use this as a blush, but I'm sure it would be nice as a blush topper too. This is the perfect blush if I want something that pairs easily with any look!

I purchased this shade based on other reviews stating it was a good colour match for olive skin tones. The colour is not quite as orangy as the chart would indicate; more of a bronze imo. Great for my colouring. I deducted one point as it is rather loose when using a brush to apply so I feel will waste a lot of product that way.,1,0,Recommends this product
