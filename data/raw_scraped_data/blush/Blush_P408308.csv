That is the first reason I decided to try this as a Bronzer. However, on my Complexion this doesn't really work. Or at least it isn't what i expected when I opened it to find the Color is person is lighter than what is shown on the screen. I will just use it as a bit of eyeshadow for a Bronze look and lip color. However, I think on a Caramel Color Person or lighter this would be a lovely Bronzer.

I like that it has cooler reddish undertones because I have rosy undertones, and for me a lot of bronzers can end up looking really unnatural because of their warmth. This is definitely not warm! Kind of looks like a blush on my bronzer brush even. I do really like it, I would compare it to the ABH bronzer in Tawny, which I previously swatched and got scared of because of how red it was. This is not highly pigmented so I feel that the red is not overwhelming and complimentary. Not sure if the shimmer on the left/lighter side is a spray over but its very pretty nonetheless. I really like all of the Kevyn Aucoin base products that I've tried. I wish the ingredients in this were better (Mica/talc) but my old bronzer (Physicians Butter Bronzer in shade Bronzer) had it as well so I won't complain too much.

Capri is the perfect color palette for my light/cool/neutral/olive complexion. I think it would work well on pale to deep cool/neutral/olive skin tones because it is sheer and buildable. No chalkiness here. The center blush is redder and a beautiful natural flush in person. This gives a very natural looking ""lit from within"" glow without looking like I am wearing bronzer. A little product goes a very long way. Blends beautifully and lasts until I remove it. Would definitely repurchase.

I love the texture and the way it's finely milled for optimal application. This bronzer gave me a healthy glow that could double as a bronze-tour. It's not too warm, which is what I look for as someone who has more fair skin. The blush perfectly complements the bronzer and gives a very healthy flush of color. The highlight is by no means metallic, but more of a soft glow. Which is what I prefer, because I feel like metallic highlighters only highlight texture and fine lines on skin. ✖️ My final thoughts are that I would repurchase this, and I definitely recommend.

blush,KEVYN AUCOIN,KEVYN AUCOIN The Neo-Bronzer,impressions,,,[],4 stars,13 Jul 2016,no,,,extremely pigmented blush,"Besides the gorgeous packaging and beautiful gradient, I think it would be honest to say that it is really hard to get specific uses from each end of the spectrum. For me, the whole palette is just an extremely pigmented blush that has a deep rust color. I love the color hence my 4 stars, but for people looking to get a 3 in one product, I don't think this will be it. It is also very pigmented, so just a slight tap is usually just enough for my cheeks.

I use a high quality soft brush, and find this product to go on smoothly and blend well. The color is good for my skin tone which is fairly pale, and doesn't have glitter or too much shimmer. For 24 grams of product, this is a good value, as far as non-drugstore make-up goes. AFter I had it for a couple weeks, I noticed Wayne Goss did a review, and he had a similar opinion.

This does tend to kick up a bit of powder when you dust you brush in it, but nothing terrible. Packaging is sturdy and not too heavy or lightweight. Medium sized brushes work best for picking up each individual color if you do not wish to mix between shades.

I found the blush and bronzer to be finely-milled and highly pigmented, and it blends beautifully. The highlighter has just the barest amount of shimmer -- I don't like too much shimmer, so this is perfect for me. I love that I can sweep my brush over different parts of this palette to get more highlight or more bronze in the blush. I don't do contour for day-to-day, but it's nice to be able to deepen the shade of blush with the bronzer. It allows me to quickly and easily create a layered, natural look. I have really pale skin. I found the colours of the blush and highlighter to be perfect -- the blush is especially quite pigmented and buildable -- but I can see how the bronzer could be too harsh for everyday contouring on someone with a pale complexion. The compact is pretty and feels nice and high-quality. The mirror is big, though the compact is still small enough that I would happily toss this into my purse.

But when I first tried it out, i immediately was disappointed in the contour shade. It's too pinky and red from the blush and even if I try to get the last centimeter to the right so there's no blush, the color still looks like a brick shade on my cheek. Also, the blush is ok, nothing incredible. The high light was very disappointing as well. I like an intense highlight so this one wasn't for me. I am returning this item. I hope his helps everyone!

I love that there are three distinct products in one (I don't know why some reviewers seem to have such a problem with this...the product is certainly big enough if I just pay attention to where I am placing my brush in the pan) and then i can also move along the Ombre and add a bit of bronze to the pink blush, great for when I am a bit darker in the summer, or on the other end, add some of the highlighter for more of a shimmery cheek color. I have quite a few face palettes (It Cosmetics, Laura Geller, Too Faced and MUFE) and this is by far my favorite!

In the store, I initially used a super fluffy brush one of the girls gave me to try it on with, and I agree it kicked up a ton of powder. I have a deep love and obsession for all things ombré and decided I would still buy it, powder kick and all. However, when I used it at home with my old school Bobbi Brown blush brush, I was able to get swipes of each section of color, and it did NOT kick up powder at all! I was thrilled! I'm super stoked for this blush-bronzer-highlight palette and may get a back up in case it ever leaves the collection. This is my first purchase from Kevin Aucoin and I'm blown away by the gorgeous packaging and the beautiful, long lasting palette. This blush later all day and I couldn't be happier.

The highlight is subtle for everyday use. You don't need to worry about looking like a disco ball. On another note the packaging is slim perfect for travel. You have all you need. Plus these transition well for an eye shadow look. Just tap your brush off first as my only gripe with this product is it's very chalky/powdery. Kicks up alot of product.

There's such a softness (look) to this palette like no other I've tried. Not harsh nor strong. A natural glow. No shimmery look. It provides a beautiful glowy sheen. Just looks so natural complimenting my skin tone which is light-medium tan. The very best natural looking sheen that brightens my look. Looks like little effort put into application. So smooth. So blend able. An overall softness to skin. Prettiest summer sun kissed look. Bronze shade is beautiful. Nothing orange about it. Love the coral blush. The overall trio is truly beautiful. I like to apply by swiping my brush across the entire palette. I'm using a denser blush brush as oppose to a big fluffy brush. Can kick up some powder. It really just speaks for itself.

blush,KEVYN AUCOIN,KEVYN AUCOIN The Neo-Bronzer,PhoenixMommy,,,[],5 stars,12 May 2016,no,,,Absolutely Stunning,"I have this palette in Capri and it is absolutely perfect for my skin tone (NW20). The texture is very similar to the Celestial Bronzer and Candlelight powders. Each shade blends beautifully and lends a gorgeous glow to the skin. There is no chunky sparkle or gritty shimmer, just beautiful glow! If you've been disappointed with other similar face trios this season, I implore you to try this one from Kevyn Aucoin...it's what I hoped all the others would be! On me the highlight is a beautiful champagne ever-so-slightly tinged with pink and the blush is a stunning medium pink that wears mostly neutral on me. The bronzer made me sooo happy, it's not orange at all...it's cooler like the Celestial Bronzer Tropical Nights. It has more of a bricky tone that cool-skinned folks will love...I know I sure do! I have a ""no back-up"" rule, but I'm strongly considering a back up of this one, it's so perfect! It does kick up some powder but not insane amounts, and they're not chalky or dry at all. The powders are actually velvety and almost creamy to the touch...absolutely divine! I was surprised to find this was a very good sized compact especially for the price, and the packaging is typical Kevyn Aucoin mahogany and gold amazingness. Definitely a huge thumbs up! I've never had a more perfect trio!
