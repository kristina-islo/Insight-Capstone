blush,KAJA,Kaja Mochi Minis Bouncy Blendable Highlighter & Blush Duo,tasnimk,VIB,Rookie,"['Eye Color Brown', 'Hair color Black', 'Skin Tone Medium', 'Skin Type Combination']",5 stars,1 Sep 2019,no,,,milky glow,"This is a great deal because I don't ever finish large highlighters or blushes because I have so many different ones. The finish on these products is so very beautiful dewy and natural, and does not make your pores look big. I love the plump glowy cheek look and this helps you get it. Application would be easier with the larger versions because you can only use one finger with these small pots, but if you don't plan on using these often, then these mini pots would be a great addition to your collection!

This is my first cream blush product and now I'm left wondering why It has taken me this long to try cream products! I swatched the blush in store and didn't think it was anything special, so I walked away. But then I saw this set online and decided to just try it. So glad I did! The blush is so beautiful and just gives you that natural rosey flush. The highlighter is subtle and not glittery, I find it good for every day use.

However, after trying it a few times, I found that it just had no payoff. I tried layering it, wetting my brush, using my fingers, and nothing really worked. Most of the glitter just stuck to my finger. I ended up returning it.",1,0,
blush,KAJA,Kaja Mochi Minis Bouncy Blendable Highlighter & Blush Duo,Harusen,VIB,Rookie,"['Eye Color Brown', 'Hair color Black', 'Skin Tone Medium', 'Skin Type Dry']",5 stars,28 Aug 2019,no,,,Perfect for minimalists,"As a makeup minimalist, I just couldn’t validate buying both in full size even though I’ve been eying them a while now. So when I recently found out there was a mini set available, I leaped for it and I’m so glad I did! They’re both very lightweight but buildable, and the packaging it super convenient. Color pay off is excellent, so a little goes a long way. I’ve got sensitive skin, but haven’t had any irritation with this formula. The mirror inside is terrible but better than nothing when you’re constantly on the go. Overall, worth it!

I really wanted to try both products, so I jumped on it. The blush is amazingly pigmented, but still makes for a really soft, glowy look. The highlight surprised me with how gorgeous it is. It doesn't overly accentuate texture, but it builds up to a beautiful glow. Both blush and highlight last a long time, too. A , will prob buy the full size of both.",0,0,Recommends this product

So glad I ordered it! Both the blush and the highlighter are lovely and blend easily with finger application. The blush is my fav - it's a beautiful rose/peach shade that I'm sure will suit many varied skin tones. Great texture too! I'm finding I really like Kaja products.,25,2,Recommends this product

Weight-wise combined, you're paying less than the price of a regular size for more product. Product-wise, these mochi minis are the cutest thing! The colours are fairly true to picture. The actual product area is about the size of a quarter, which is decent for finger application, but my regular blush brush had a bit of trouble picking up products evenly. However, I did find that finger application yields best colour payoff for both products anyway, and they both blend really well with fingers, too. The blush is a true cream to powder formula, but I find the highlight to lean more powdery right off the pot. There're definitely sparkles in the highlight, but nothing too chunky. Overall, I think these are great products, and would be the perfect travel buddies!
