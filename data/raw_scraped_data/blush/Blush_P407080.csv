The soft matte formula stays very well on my cheeks throughout the day, and fades after a few hours on my lips. It's so easy to touch up, especially thanks to the easy-to-carry travel tin with the mirror. This formula is also super easy to layer and blend with other nudestix products, so I like to create custom colors sometimes. It blends beautifully with the Gel Color in Haven to create a peachy pink sunset shade that I adore. Overall a fabulous item to have on hand!

Now here comes there 'Major Flop' portion. Within minutes of applying the product to my lips it began to crack along my natural lines of my lips. When I would move my lips the product would stick to itself and clump up. I tried again and did'nt make facial expressions for awhile. You know, maybe it needed dry time? Nope. still didnt help. After about 30 minutes it still cracked. Then one sip of coffee and nearly all of the product came off. To me this product isn't worth the hassle. There are plenty of other products similar that don't crack or transfer so much so quickly. To be fair I have not try this on my cheeks.

Lips look matte but they are not dry at all. Actually, they feel pleasantly moisturized and very soft. NudeStix does not cake and stays on my lips for a few hours. It has a nice, creamy texture. I also wear it as a cheek blush. I apply it on my finger first and then distribute over my cheeks. My skin tone is rather fair (gets darker in the summer) and the ""Kiss"" matches my complexion perfectly. Oh, just in case you care about the country of origin, my NudeStix pencil was made in Germany.

It’s a really nice, flattering pop of pink. The formula is super creamy and not at all drying on the lips. It doesn’t have the longest wear, though - I found it to be 4 hours, max - and it will definitely need reapplied if you are eating or drinking. I don’t like that it needs sharpened, it makes it messy and you waste product because it comes off with the shavings. I never tried it as a cheek color because it’s not a color I’d want to wear as blush so I have nothing to say on that. There’s a decent amount of product here, but not enough to justify price. You’re definitely paying mostly for the packaging, which is nice (it has a mirror inside the lid), but not extremely functional to carry around (it doesn’t hold much- maybe two of these lip pencils or similar items, at the most) and it scratches very easily. Overall, I might buy again, but only if I can’t find a color dupe elsewhere, first.

On Sephora, the shade is described as a ""cool toned rosy pink"", but I would not describe it as cool toned at all. It's more like neutral-to-warm, dark pink. It's insanely pigmented and glides on very smooth. It doesn't feel heavy or cakey like many matte lip products. I haven't tried it on my cheeks but I think this would probably make a really pretty blush color. The sample size has quite a lot of product and it will take me some time to use this up. I tend to shy away from pencil lip products as my experience in the past has been that sharpening is a real pain. I haven't sharpened this one yet so I can't comment on whether it's easy to sharpen or not.

blush,NUDESTIX,NUDESTIX Love is Louder Lip + Cheek Pencil,juniormint76,Rouge,Rookie,"['Eye Color Brown', 'Hair color Black', 'Skin Tone Light', 'Skin Type Dry']",4 stars,19 Sep 2018,no,Color: Kiss,https://www.sephora.com/productimages/sku/s1783786+sw.jpg,Impressed by the Staying Power!,"This lip pencil is a gorgeous rose shade that reads just a hint brighter in person than the muted swatch shown on the site. I'm actually a big fan of the color - I have a lot of cool-toned dusty rose shades in my collection, but this is a warmer version that doesn't wash me out as much (I'm pretty fair). The wear time is great: I applied it in the AM and it didn't move, even through my morning coffee and bagel. And that's saying something because usually even the most budge-proof lipsticks don't stay on when I eat (I'm not a messy eater, I promise!). As the day goes on it starts to fade a little, but not in an obvious way - you have to get really close to be able to tell. If you reapply though, it goes on a little patchier the second time around. The formula is very soft and creamy, so much so that I actually broke the pencil tip when I got it and had to sort of smush it back on so it wouldn't go to waste. But that does make for a smooth, fuss-proof application.

Even chap sticks make my lips split or crinkle, but this lip and cheek pencil keeps my sensitive lips together. The pencil is smooth, easy to use and works as a lip liner, lip stick and blush that you can shear out or build up for either a hint of color or bold pop. The only problem I have with it is that unlike other Nudestix products I've used, it fades over time. But, the ease of carrying it around in my purse makes up for it.
