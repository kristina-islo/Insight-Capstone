I’m pretty new to this whole beauty thing, and am still trying to figure out which products work best for me — especially as I’m finding that my face likes to throw me curveballs on a daily basis. I have fairly significant rosacea and am also a blood thinner, which while saving my life further flushes my already pale face. When that underlying redness is off the chart, it completely changes how everything, especially blush, looks on me, so I wanted something with a bit of a gradient I could adjust easily. I was slightly worried when I opened this and saw what to my untrained eye looked like glitter, but I literally gasped aloud in delight when I finally applied it. It was absolutely stunning from the get; super easy for rookie me to work with, silky and luminous without being glittery, and I love that I can play with the shade and intensity depending on my daily wants and needs. It looks great with a lot of build, but even just a swipe leaves a beautiful wash of color. It’s also played very well with my skincare and other face products (mainly Dior Forever Matte liquid foundation and both Laura Mercier and Hourglass tinted moisturizers.) I already have Pink Sand in my cart and am so excited to add another Kevyn Aucoin product to my stash, because I know it’ll look stunning. Can’t say enough good things.

When it arrived last week, I pulled this slim, minimalist compact out of the box and tried it immediately. Holy...grail! I don’t think I’ve ever used a single cosmetic that immediately *transformed* my face. This is the most beautiful, delicate blush I’ve ever used. I had zero makeup on when I applied it the first time. It made my face blossom. That’s the only word I can think of that’s a perfect description. I purchased the Rose Cliff shade(s), based on my slightly peachy skin tone. It’s a powder blush, which I’m trying to avoid because women over 50 should usually stick to cream or liquid blush; the powder can cake easily and settle into lines & crow’s feet. But the Neo-Blush is a creamy, silky powder that applies beautifully, smooth as a cream or gel on dry, aging skin. The colour was ridiculous! SO rich, but subtle and artistic. It looks like an actual blush that your skin creates naturally. It won’t settle into fine lines, has no sparkle or glitter, and simply made my face look young, naturally flush, and surprisingly pretty. Even without any other makeup on. The Neo-Blush is designed as a spectrum of colors, ranging from lightest to darkest, where each tone by itself looks great on your skin. I go right for the center color for my cheeks and forehead. Then I use the darker peach-pink tone to contour a small bit under my cheekbones. The color pigment is perfect and lasts for several hours, especially with a light spritz of Caudalie Grape Water (my version of setting spray.) Kevyn Aucoin, wherever he or she may be, is a color genius. I’ve been devoted to my Ilia Color Haze (liquid blush) in Before Today or Warm Haze, and it convinced me that cream/liquid blush is better for over-50 skin. But this Neo-Blush genius powder deserves 10 stars. My face and my husband love this gorgeous product.

I love these blushes as you can create different looks and still look natural. Great color pay off as well. You get 3 colors in one which makes the price worth it to me. I am tan skinned and these two blush palettes looked great on my skin tone. I do plan on purchasing the PinkSand next. My one MAJOR problem is that when you first purchase the blushes they are sparkly, vibrant, shimmery. After a few uses the shimmer is gone, and the palette becomes COMPLETELY MATTE. Meaning, they top these blushes with shimmer to make it appealing, but really you are buying a matte blush palette. They do not stay sparkly and shiny. Which is a huge negative, because I love the shimmer. It gives you a glow effect, but no longer is a glow effect once the shimmer is gone. I still highly recommend these palettes, though.

The shimmer is mature and not heavy- when applied it blends in and enhances the cheekbones. It would work on a wide range of skin tones, I found I had to be light handed when using it. Sunset seems like it would work for olive and deeper tones. Out of all of them I did not like Pink Sand. I ddn't try it on my face but it was rather plain and when it's colors were mixed it created an odd color of pink, more of what an infection around a cut looks like. I am glad I swatched these in store before purchasing because I would have bought Pink Sand if I had not swatched in store since I am pale and it seemed to be the safest bet. Hopefully this helps others on the fence.

I’ve set my eye on their neo-highlighter for a while and couldn’t make myself spend that much money on a highlighter/blush... and then this one came out! It’s definitely smaller but the colours are so beautiful! I got it during the 15% off event and got so much compliments since. The packaging also looks good quality.,30,0,Recommends this product
