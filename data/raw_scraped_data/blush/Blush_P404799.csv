I used this on my lips and the texture was a little waxy and the color faded quickly (surprisingly so because the blush on cheeks is very pretty) It’s not as pigmented as other cream blushes so when you apply on cheeks and blend it out, it will disappear on the first swipe. I find that it works best if you sweep it across your cheek bones twice, lightly blend, then go back & dot the product on the apples of the cheeks & pat to soften. The mini is great to keep in your purse as a quick touch up for cheeks only.

It is very creamy and glowy/moisturizing on the skin. I also really like the color I received. One thing I like is how it isn’t shimmery or glittery like other blushes. It gives your skin a dewy glow that makes it look very natural. It says you can use it on your lips but I tried that and it was instantly way to dry and waxy for that. Recommend it just for the face. I use this on bare skin so I don’t know how it is with makeup underneath. Definitely recommend.

I've never really though that I could wear blush since most I've seen are really light, pale pinks, which I wasn't a fan of. But I love this deep purple color, and that it can be used on your lips and cheeks! It's a kind of sheer color, but easily buildeable! It also kinda smells like berries. I really like using this on my lips, it's really moisturizing, and when it dries down, leaves kind of a stain. It doesn't really seem to last too long on my cheeks, like powder blush does, but it gives a really natural glowy effect which I wanted! And it's easy to apply directly or with a brush. There is also a lot of product in this. I've had this for about 6 months and have barely used up any of it. I would recommend this product, just wish it lasted longer on the cheeks.

The colour is the perfect everyday nude, it looks a bit darker in thé tube but when applied to the cheeks is gorgeous. I don’t recommend using it in the lips, of course you can try, as it is a bit drying. If you want I may tap the product on your lips and top with a gloss. At first I was iffy because I feel it didn’t blend the best when the stick is applied straight to the face, so I found the best technique is rub your finger in the blush, using the warmth of your finger and dab onto the face, then you can blend out with your fingers a brush or sponge. The little milk birthday kit is very valuable, as the mini blush itself retails for $20 Canadian, and you don’t need to purchase the biggest size because the mini comes with so much product. I would highly highly recommend.

After enough experimentation, I've decided that I like it on top of clean skin but not on top of foundation. I assume because it's more watery and jelly, it must do something to foundation that lifts the product. I say this because every time I've attempted to put it on top of my foundation (Charlotte Tilbury or Fenty) my foundation lifts, and I have to do my face all over again. I've decided it only works on bare skin. With that being said, when I am going for a more natural make up look I really like it. :)

The product itself looks very natural, looks like you’re naturally blushing, it’s satin, has a tiny tiny bit shine what makes it look healthy. I can’t say that there’s something that I don’t like about this product, the only feedback is that it doesn’t really last whole day, so you have to touch up definitely. For 28$ you get a LOOOOT of product that will last years, even the mini version will last more than a year. I give it 4 stars just because it’s not very long lasting (as I said before). Is it a must have in your makeup bag? I don’t think so, but If you are a creamy product lover than you should definitely try this out, you’ll love this.

My skin is very dry so i cannot use powder. Perhaps Milk can add something to this to make it last. Pretty though-it has a little sparkle too (not too much, just enough) so I have not returned it because it does look good. I put it on OR reapply just before I go somewhere special.",3,0,Recommends this product
