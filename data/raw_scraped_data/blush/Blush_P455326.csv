I feel like you can barely tell I have blush on and I love that about it. I have fair skin with freckles and dark; almost black hair. This is a gorgeous peachy shade that looks very natural. I love it and I think it’s my new daily blush!,2,2,Recommends this product

When swatching on my hand, the shade is very light peach and pretty. However, I cannot for the life of me get it to stay on my face! I tried different brushes, but it won't work. 1-star for transparent ""blush""",11,1,

As someone with pale skin that's nearly translucent, this is a lovely peach option that doesnt pull too orange. However, I can definitely see how this wouldn't really show up on darker skintones. It smells sweet and I'm looking forward to using this for spring and summer!",6,0,Recommends this product
blush,BENEFIT COSMETICS,Benefit Cosmetics Georgia Blush,southern16,Rouge,Rookie,"['Eye Color Hazel', 'Hair color Red', 'Skin Tone Light', 'Skin Type Oily']",2 stars,3 Mar 2020,no,,,No pigment,There’s nothing there.. If I swatch it 3 times on my hand I can get pigment but on a brush.. there’s nothing. I really wanted to like this since I’m from Georgia and peach is my favorite color but for $30 I don’t think so. Will be returning it.,17,5,
