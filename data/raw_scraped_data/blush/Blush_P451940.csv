The shade sincere looks like a nudey peachy shade on my skin and pairs well with anyyy eye look but also looks great without any makeup. I was rrly scared to try out this shade in particular because of all the reviews of it not swatching properly on darker skin tones but that’s not true! On my hands it doesn’t swatch as pigmented but on my face it looks sooo stunning. If you do have brown skin tone and you’re looking for a peachy blush , definitely check this out !

When I tried the product, it took about 4 dips in the pan to see a difference on my face, and by then my cheek just had a film of ashy-looking shimmer, and no color. I really wanted the color of this blush to come through, however it did not. One amazing thing about this product is that it has 10.5 grams of product, and blushes tend to have 5 to 6 grams of product, so having to dip in many times is not a deal-breaker. It came down to the lack of pigment, and abundance of shimmer that ruined the product.

I love a blush that is more of a buildable formula since it's easier then to control how much you put on, but these are bordering on being a bit too sheer. I will say though that once built up on the cheeks this color is beautiful and they never look powdery or cakey even though it takes a lot of building it. The texture is soft and silky and the shade She's Sincere has a slight sheen to it that is barely even noticeable. If you love a blush that packs a punch then unfortunately I do not think that these, well at least the color I got, will be for you. Even if you're like me and love a more sheer buildable blush, you may love these, or you may hate them because they are very very sheer and I'm not even exaggerating when I say that. I do think that I may order one of the ""darker"" shades to see if the formula is the same.

After viewing and swatching the testers in store however, I ultimately decided to purchase She’s Passionate (soft pink). As previous reviewers have stated, finger swatches DO NOT do these blushes justice!! I could barely pick up any product on my fingers to get a decent swatch in store but this did not deter my purchase as I was confident that Patrick Ta would not release a subpar product. I use a tapered/pointed blush brush to slowly build up the pigmentation of this blush, or will go in directly with a slanted blush brush for a more immediate impact and then blend out the product. The blush looks so pretty both ways!! If I look very closely to my cheeks after application I can detect a very fine golden shimmer there (which is not noticeable at all in the pan), but from a normal distance the cheeks appear to have a healthy glow. As an added bonus, this blush doesn’t emphasize any texture on my cheeks and has longer staying power on my combination skin than the majority of my other blushes!! This is one of my favorite blushes for “no makeup” makeup looks and everyday wear. I already have way too many peach blushes in my collection but am tempted to add She’s Sincere to my arsenal next...

Nothing new here. Laura Mercier new blushes are way better. I’m kinda disappointed with this launch. It seems a bit too powdery and the color just sits on my cheeks. It doesn’t look natural at all. Maybe I picked the wrong color ?,5,1,

To my dismay, when I went to return to it, I couldn't find it. I tried everything! I asked for friends, there is truly not a blush on the market I liked. It either had too much shimmer, was too pink, too red, too coral, never the right mix of ... everything. Then I tried this and I was sold. It is beauty on the skin looks great with multiple skin colors, and just adds that little bit of warmth perfect for all year round.

I have light-medium skin and I’m not a fan of bright blush. I love the Tarte blushes because of the staying power but even their nude blushes are still a little too pigmented for my liking. This blush however is my holy grail and makes me WANT to use blush! It applies beautifully with a brush and it’s buildable to your liking! It’s super user friendly! The finish is beautiful too... it like melts into your skin! I ended up ordering two more colors online! This is a fantastic blush and I see myself using this for the long run!

It’s a beautiful soft pink and really compliments my light skin tone. However, the color payoff isn’t the best I’ve used (you really have to dig in it to get the product onto the brush) and it doesn’t seem to stay. After a couple of hours it seems to disappear. I’ve tried different primers, foundations, and setting spray but I just can’t get it to last! I’m going to keep trying it because the color is so beautiful and the packaging is nice, but I’m not totally sold.

Don’t get me wrong, I LOVE a buildable blush. But this one I literally have to scratch my brush into it to get the most minimal payoff. The formula is DRY and tbh it looks really dry on the face as well. I was also disappointed in the shade she’s seductive which was supposed to be a mauve plum. It just looked like any other coral blush on the face. The packaging is beautiful but I’m really disappointed in the product itself.
