Turns out I love them all. Sometimes bronzers can look muddy/dirty on me, but the hoola is perfect. As is sugarbomb. Just a really great, universally flattering blush shade and I love how it transforms when you put georgia over the top. Warms it up a bit. My only complaint is that it doesn't wear very long, but I have yet to meet a blush that does on my skin.

I was kind of disappointed in Georgia. The shade was so light and it didn’t really build up well. (And I’m light/medium skin tone) Sugar bomb really saved this palette. It’s such a nice pink rosy color. It gives your cheeks a nice healthy glow. And I have enough Hoola for lifetime. I would recommend save your money and just buy SugarBomb alone.,6,0,

The pigmentation is decent. I’m not a huge fan of Hoola but I like the other two colors. I wish they’d stop putting it in everything. I got a mini Dallas and I’ll probably try and swap out the hoola for Dallas and give hoola to a friend. I’ve had sugarbomb in the past and enjoy the nice pink pop. Georgia is pretty but subtle on light-medium skin. It’ll be a good travel palette for me if I’m able to swap the pans out without destroying the packaging.
