They don’t look too powdery or too shimmery on the face. But they are very illuminating. This colour Love is the drug is the one I wear the least. It’s the darkest one I own. I use it for evening or if I’m looking washed out. It’s more pigmented than my others so I recommend using a blush brush with softer bristles and a light hand to apply.

I have Love Glow and Pillow Talk and let me just say that Sephora’s product image for both colors is way off, pillow talk is much darker almost brown, and love glow is pinker! At first I hated the color Pillow talk, loved the formula because it’s smooth & silky and blends like a dream. But the color really looked awful on my fair complexion. It looked orangey-brown. I recently decided to give it another try using a MAC 133 brush, swirling it around the darker shade and then lightly applying to my cheekbones in small circular blending motions. Then I went over it with the middle shade and the result is a beautiful natural flush! Not brown or orange at all. Love Glow has been my go-to blush ever since I got it. It is peachy-pink and gives a very pretty peachy-pink flush. Its nicely pigmented and buildable, it goes on smoothly and blends like a dream. I don’t think the packaging it cheap it all, it comes in a mirrored compact. I have not had any issues with breakage and have dropped Love Glow several times. I’d like to purchase more colors but need to see them in person because the product photos are really off.

Love Is The Drug cost me $50 CAD and was returned the next day. The lighter pink color texture resembles chalk, applies unevenly and last for about an hour. The smaller brighter pink color is exactly the same. The two colors do not provide a fresh look, What you end up with is dry/matte looking cheekbones with a smudge of pink on the apples. The amount of actual product in the pan is laughable for the price. One of the worst blush products I have ever used, and I've purchased a lot of blush in my time.. Save your money. This blush is garbage. Talk about the influence of celebrity endorsements, that is the only thing this product has going for it.

I use a light hand and layer, and it really brightens up my face. I love pairing this with Bite Fuschia Frosting. - Finely-milled, doesn't cake on. This is what Temptalia said, and she's absolutely spot-on: ""I think what makes this different from your standard gold-shimmered pink blushes is that the pink is rather cool-toned, which may make it more flattering on those with cooler complexions who have tried the warmer options and found them lacking.

I bought two separate colors, and it happened to both. The compacts didn't break like many other reviewers stated happened to them, but just the fact that we have this many issues with this blush shows there's a major problem in both the product and the packaging. It really needs an overhaul to compare with the extremely high quality products that CT is known for! I'm still going to buy her line of cosmetics, because these blushes were the only ones that I've ever had a problem with, all her other products that I've tried are outstanding, especially her lipsticks!

Love is the drug is a beautiful pink color on my medium neutral slightly olive skin that matches with everything. It’s a great color to pop on when in a rush and you don’t have time to think twice about putting a look together so you need something universally flattering. The formula was soft and a little dusty, but such a dream to apply and blend out. I only took off one star because it seemed to fade a bit more than my other high-end blushes around the 9-10 hour mark.

Love drug and sex on fire didn’t show up on me at all and I’m light/medium skin tone depending on the season. I tried to layer them on and I never really saw color pay off. I kept ecstasy and love is the drug as they were brighter in pigment and showed up well. I still had to layer more on than I usually would with a dior blush or hourglass blush. I may try pillow talk as it looks to be bright as well. If you are fair in skin tone the lighter shades may do well for you but I just couldn’t justify keeping them since I’d never use them. The color seems to last well during the day and the shimmer is very flattering. It isn’t a glitter party with huge chunks which is great. For the price, I think I’d go with hourglass before I’d buy another CT blush just because I’ve never been disappointed with hourglass blushes.

Smooth application! I really love how this blush is so versatile; you're basically getting three shades in one! You can use the outer ring color, the center shade, or swirl the two together! I like to do Charlotte's suggested swish and pop method best. I have fair skin and this blush is not too dark or too bright on me, but I think it would brighten up the face on a darker skin tone as well! I have nothing bad to say about this blush!

Use it everyday and it is the perfect shade for my skin. It goes on great and stays most of the day.

It hasn't broken me out or anything like that, and lasts all day long. I love layering the two different shades! There's a bit of shimmer, but not too much, which I prefer in a blush. Just enough to give a bit of a glow but not see actual glitter on the cheeks. I found this shade (Ecstasy) to be perfect for my skin (I'm on the more fair side). Can be worn very subtly or built up for a more dramatic look. The packaging feels very luxe and it's a pleasure to use every day.

I have been thoroughly enjoying this blush. On me (very fair skin) it shows up as a slightly sheer, neutral to slightly warmish pink with a very light, non-glittery shimmer. I can build this up without worrying about going overboard and I love the healthy flush it gives me. I ordered this blush in the Pillow Talk shade earlier today and I'm looking forward to comparing the two.
