blush,SURRATT BEAUTY,surratt beauty Artistique Blush,kittykatt612,Rouge,Rookie,"['Eye Color Brown', 'Hair color Black', 'Skin Tone Light', 'Skin Type Combination']",4 stars,17 d ago,yes,Color: Aureole,https://www.sephora.com/productimages/sku/s1672906+sw.jpg,"5 Stars for the Product, 3.5 Stars for the Size","I recently purchased this blush in the shade La Vie en Rose. This product gives my cheeks a beautiful nude-pink flush and it fits right in with my preferred color family as far as cheek products go. However, I was not expecting it to be as tiny as it is! One could argue that it's a good product to keep in your makeup bag for that reason, but I was very surprised when I actually opened the package. When I went to check out the metrics on other comparable blushes, the value for money actually isn't far off from other blushes within the same price range. I'm thinking the packaging might account for the jarring physical differences. Here is this blush and other blushes in my collection that are within the same color family. Surratt Beauty Artistique Blush - $32 | 0.14 oz/ 4 g. NARS blush - $30 | 0.16 oz/ 4.8 g. Charlotte Tilbury blush - $40 | 0.28 oz/ 8g. HOURGLASS Ambient Lighting Mini Blush Mini - $24 | 0.04 oz/ 1.3 g. LORAC Color Source Buildable Blush - $23 | 0.17. Tarte 9 Ways Cheek to Chic Blush | (9 cheek products for $35) | 0.077 oz/ 2.2 g per pan. The NARS blush is $2 cheaper than the Surratt Beauty blush and is .2 oz bigger. The Charlotte Tilbury blush is $8 more but has twice as much product. I ultimately decided to keep this blush because it really is a pretty shade and I think it will be a good blush to have in my makeup bag because it is so slim. However, I wish the packaging wasn't as flimsy - there is no contact, it's just a plastic deck and the pan slides in and out. Hopefully this reviewed helped some of you out there who are interested in buying this product!

For reference , Tarte Foundcealer in 27n is my summer foundation color. I bought this in Chaleur which is described as sun kissed nude. I think that description is accurate. It is a warm peachy brownish nude that looks like I spent the day at the beach but with sunscreen and a hat. It’s a hint of color that makes a difference for those of us who like natural looking makeup. This has a bit of a sheen but is close to matte. It’s very sheer and natural looking. You can build the color or layer it with another blush or bronzer. I do it with Laura Mercier Bronze 2 bronzer. I’ve bought a couple of Surratt brushes, Lipsliques, and this is my second blush. ( the other is actually the contour color.) i’m impressed with the brand and the formulation of this blush. I will probably pick up a few more.

To be blunt, each pan is about the size of two large eyeshadows. Smaller than the Nars pans by about a 1/3. Anyway. Besides my clear issue over the size, these are beautiful, pigmented colors that blend like a dream. I like to use them as eyeshadows as well as blushes, especially since Guimauve makes me look a bit too doll-like when I use it as a blush. So as long as you're okay with the price versus the pan size, this is a good purchase.

This color is beautiful- a shimmery rose that isn't too dark. It is very buildable. On my fair skin with a neutral tone I usually blend it out quite a bit and I love the look- when I'm a bit more tan I really enjoy letting the rose shine through more on my cheeks and when I'm more fair I sheer it out.

This color is amazing- it blends out to be a shimmery glisten of light pink which looks amazing. The photos on the sephora website don't do it justice. It's not chalky - it's a hint of the most beautiful light true pink that blends easily with highlighter and bronzer or alone. LOVE this. So happy I splurged. A little goes a very long way. Don't be thrown off by the small product size.

NOTE: you do need to buy the carrying case (not expensive) for your products- they are very delicate and small and need protection. This is a beautiful light highlighter that I bought that shimmers (no glitter) and I bought it with two blushes that I put in the compact. It is highly pigemented, a light hand is needed or a very soft (goat hair) brush... it is stunning. Everytime I wear it people say I look healthy and beautiful and it truly completes the look. The picture here makes it look coral toned, but it truly is more champagne hued but without a yellow undertone (confusing...but good) which makes it just an iridescent highlighter. I find it suits my neutral skin tone perfectly and blends seamlessly with either Surratt blushes or any of my other blushes and bronzers. LOVE LOVE LOVE

I would also say it's fairly long lasting as it survived the 8 hour work day quite nicely. It seems like a lot of people aren't fans of the packaging--I agree with them.

After owning 2 Surratt blushes, I feel kind of silly having all of these other blushes because I hardly ever use them anymore. I use both Chaleur and La Vie En Rose simultaneously (high maintenance, I know). I like to sweep Chaleur across my cheeks from apple to ear, and I swirl La Vie En Rose just on my apples. It gives such a beautiful and natural flush to my cheeks and goes well with most make-up looks I do. The powder feels so soft and buttery and applies so beautifully. It has the perfect amount of pigmentation and blends seamlessly on top of foundation. This blush is admittedly quite pricey when you consider how small the pan is, but it really is the most gorgeous blush I've ever used so far. As far as packaging concerns that other people are mentioning, I don't have a problem with it. This product is meant more for pro artists so it has to be small and compact, like the Viseart palettes.

When this arrived I was very surprised how tiny it is - much less product than the other blushes I own, and the plastic casing seems flimsy. I ordered a matte shade and found it to be fairly chalky and little color payoff. Maybe the shimmery shades have a different formula and are more creamy, but this was not. Overall you can find much better (smooth and pigmented) blush elsewhere and get more for your money!

They add a realistic glow to the skin. They are buildable so it's hard to over-do it (at least with the shades I own). I like everything except the packaging. The pans come in cheap, thin plastic and adhere to the palettes with a sticker. A sticker. Seriously. For this price, I don't expect a sticker anything. Magnetic would be much more appropriate. But, I still enjoy the product and would recommend, but be aware of the packaging.

I really think that people are judging the size based on how it arrives. There isn't excess packaging, it comes as basic as could be because these are meant to be put into a palette!! For reference, they are .14oz, and a Nars blush is .16oz. Yes, you get a bit more for the $30 you pay for Nars, but I wouldn't say that an extra $2 for a bit less product is a huge deal which would make what you get to be ""too small"". I LOVE the ones I got. I got La Rosee du Soir (a very light peachy-nude which has the slightest of pink tints, very pretty) and Cherubique (a light-medium rose with more noticeable shimmer, very beautiful). They are super pigmented, smooth, and apply nicely to the cheeks. They last all day and are really some of the best blushes I've ever tried. I plan to get Aureole and Grisaille next, and will probably get more blushes once I have the money! I promise these are so worth it and you'll love them.

The blush can slide out in my purse and get completely messed up; or, I can't touch up my cheeks because it doesn't come with a mirror. At $30 something a piece, I shouldn't be compelled to arrange them in a palette to feel the product is ""complete"". Each blush should be a stand-alone piece. I was actually thinking, the product might have been a lot more popular if it come with a full packaging, which would most definitely make the blush appear to be ""bigger"" and the overall product to be more expensive because right now it just looked too much like an over-priced thin slice of colored powder.

The colors (I have Parfait, Canteloupe, Vie en Rose) give a realistic flush that meshes seamlessly with the skin. Pigmentation is intense so I use a very soft brush that deposits small amounts of color. Buffing each layer into the skin will intensify the color and ensures diffused edges. I don't care about the packaging because mine go into a Z-paleete anyway but if you are into luxe compacts, this doesn't cut it. It is costly but I need less of this than other powder blushes. There is no dupe that I'm aware of. I'd love to see Troy S. extend the color range, just as he has for his lip crayons.

It's nice that it easily slides but I'd recommend putting it in a palette with a magnetic bottom or taping the over over it if you want to put it in your purse. The plastic slider is nice because you can see the color. The blush is small and easy to travel with. The problem is that the cover slides off way too easily, that the product can rub off and crumble in your bag if you aren't careful. The product itself is beautiful. Nice color payoff and buildable. Very silky as others have said. The color pictured on the website for Rouger, looks different than in real life. Or maybe it's my monitor settings. To describe it, I like to think of a rich rhubarb color. It's warm toned. I recommend it for all skin tones. For light skin tones I would say use a light amount on your fluffy cheek brush. You can build it if you want it more noticeable. Light pressure during application. Medium/tan skin tones (which I am), I would say you can use two layers of this lightly. It gives such a nice warm glow. Darker skin tones, it will really bring your look together. It's bright but a rich bright color. It's not like a neon bright color. It has depth and warmth so it compliments your skin tone. I've use it on some clients and it shows up and looks great. I top it off with rose gold or copper becca highlighter.

Though definitely a powder, it's so silky and smooth that you'll swear it's a cream. The brand calls it slurry-technology, but I call it pixie magic as it's really unlike anything I've come across. And, I can't stop touching it as the texture is just so pleasing. There is absolutely zero kick-up when you run your brush across the pan and it applies as silky as it feels. I'm super-fair with cool undertones and I purchased Guimauve and La Vie En Rose along with the Petite Palette to give them a home. It was easy to peel off the labels on the bottoms of the blush pans and secure them into the palette. I know some are not pleased that this method requires purchasing at least two blushes or a combination of blush and eyeshadow, but, take heart and know that you're probably going to want at least two of these blushes in your life. Back to the shades...Guimauve is a light, candy-pink shade that looks a little bright in the pan, but applies as a soft, baby pink with ever-so-slight cool undertones. It's girly and lovely times a hundred. Though nicely pigmented, it is a light shade, so it may be best suited for fair to medium skintones. La Vie En Rose is a soft, neutral, rosy-pink with a hint of plum. In the pan, this looks a little brown and drab, but it comes to life on the skin and gives a gorgeous, subtle, rosy glow that looks prim, proper, and polished. It's one of those shades that should be universally flattering. Neither shade contains a hint of shimmer, but both provide soft illumination and create that coveted ""lit-from-within"" glow. They both apply like a dream with little to no blending. After using them exclusively for a few weeks, it's really difficult to go back to my other powder blushes as the texture of these is really unparalleled. I have my eye on several other shades and definitely want to try the highlighting shade (Aureole). I have a feeling there may be a Grande Palette in my future.

I absolutely love that I can mix and match the blushes and eye shadows to make a customized palette. It's so handy. Surratt blushes are the only blushes I have in my collection. I love the formula that much. It is so silky and easy to blend. I currently have Grimauve, Duchesse (a bit too light for me), La Vie En Rose, Aureole, and Grisaille. (I have my eye on Cantaloup for summer.) Grimauve is my favorite - it's stunning. It's the perfect pink flush. The contour is also on heavy rotation for me - it's a fantastic color for my light skin. I keep a large custom case (also by Surratt) with the Grimauve, Grisaille and the Aureole highlighter. Having all three of those items in one neat palette has really streamlined my morning beauty routine. About the packaging - no, it isn't for everyone. The pans are not heavy. They're plastic. Because the blushes (and eye shadows) are meant to be placed into the palettes they are not really made to stand alone.

Firstly, the quality of these products is amazing. I'm excited to try a new type of product, in that these use slurry technology to fill the pans. Secondly, I do like the palette packaging, HOWEVER, they really needed to add magnets. I ended up getting the grande palette instead of leaving the items loose, but you only just pop the items in there with no adhesive of any kind. Um, that makes me VERY nervous. I know when you close the lid, it'll keep the products in, but I still have a fear that they'll shift, crumble, or crack since they are not reinforced with glue or magnets.

Thinking they were out for a while they must be good, I finally ordered the highlighter. I heard it was small but once i saw it in person i was shocked. I've uploaded pics from my IG comparing it to the Kevyn Aucoin Candlelight highlighter. *size: On the left is the Kevyn Aucoin candlelight highlighter .11oz vs the surratt .14oz (box) or .2oz on product ; not sure which is correct. The packaging is so small ! Normally I wouldn't care but I personally find it so flimsy that I can't justify the price. It's a plastic pan and a clear tray that slides open, there's nothing practical about it. *pigment: to me I find the KA candlelight to be a softer highlighter for everyday use, but it is so much more pigmented whereas the surratt has to built up and isn't as bright as I would like. I'm not one that needs a metallic high shine highlighter but this was all fine sparkly bits and not a ton of color payoff. It really had to be built up for something that wasn't as spectacular after several layers This is unfortunately going back as I'm just not impressed and have others I prefer more. There is also a palette you can buy to customize yourself but the pans are not magnetic, and gluing or taping them in is inconvenient in the long run.

The first blush, and my favourite, is Guimauve. It's a pretty, blue based, candy pink and is perfect for my fair complexion. It goes on soft and has a lovely stain finish. Duchess is the most stunning pale peach, but almost invisible on my pinkish cheeks. I'm keeping it anyway and hoping I can use it over something that is too dark. Grisaille is a contour and works for me because I'm fair. I'm not sure it will show up on someone with a darker complexion. It’s not completely matte, as we're told contours should be, but happily, the shimmer isn't visible on the skin. It gives a natural contour effect and I never see any harsh lines because it is so subtle. The last blush I bought was Aureole, which is a golden highlighter and yes, it's also finely milled, soft and creamy, but far too yellow based and with too much of a frosty finish.This was the only one I didn't love. I retuned it the next day.

It says 6g on the package but 4g on the case. To me it looks like 4g. 2. Like most Japanese brand makeup, these blushes are really really tiny small, they look big in the pictures though. The size is perfect for just adding a little liveness onto your cheeks daily. If you are to create your own palette this is good size.(2 eyeshadowa + 1 blush) 3. They are made using typical Japanese powder formula. It is kind of similar to Shiseido trio eyeshadow for the way how the shadows are slurried into the pan. (I guess slurry here means liquid into pan rather than dry pressed?) The texture however is better than the Shiseido shadows, more pigmented and silky, less powdery. 4. you may notice many Japanese powder makeup contain mineral oil/petrolatum. In north America people try to avoid it in cosmetics. I personally prefer mineral oil over natural oil for powder makeup just because it is more stable and last longer without having stale odour. It also makes the texture thinner and silkier.

They are soft, but do not kick up excess powder when brushed. The finish is a glitter-free luminous satin-matte. I think that the lighter shades are a bit too subtle, and I'll probably go through them trying to build up the color. They only show a little bit on me, and I have light skin. The texture is beautiful though, and it melds into the skin. The dark/bright color I have is beautiful. Very pigmented, a little bit is all that is needed. I thought I'd add some swatches and comparisons, since this brand is not widely available
