However, whenever i swatched them at the store i wasnt impressed, therefore couldnt bring myslef to purchase the full sizes. So when i saw this dou i thought it would be the perfect opportunity to give these a channce, because i know some makeup performs better than it swatches. Well, i was dissapointed. The blush color payoff is barely there; what you do get is glitter. The glitter is chunky and streaky, not good. The bronzer wouldnt show up! I tried several brushes and even my fingers but nothing could get this bronzer to work, either it wouldnt show or it would make my face seem muddy/dirty. I am fairly light so its not that the bronzer would be too light for me. Save your money, not worth the hype.

Orgasm looks very nice with my light/neutral complexion and it looks peachy with a light shimmer on me. I found I had to build it using my blush brush for it to be seen at all. In comparison to other brand's blushes, NARS Orgasm is not a highly pigmented blush. The bronzer is also light on me and once I get a tan in the summer, it might look better. For the bronzer to be seen, it needs several sweeps with the brush to be seen. Not sure I would purchase the full sized versions of both based on how I have seen this travel sized duo's performance.

blush,NARS,NARS Blush/Bronzer Duo,AgeToGrace,,,"['Age over 54', 'Skin Type Combination']",5 stars,15 Feb 2017,no,,,"great little duo, but if you have mature skin...","This is a great little duo with a couple of caveats. The Nars bronzer is my all time favorite - It is very natural with just a tad of shimmer, blends easily, and is perfect for day or evening wear. That is not the case with the orgasm blush. It is a beautiful color blush, but it does have quite a bit of shimmer and sparkle. That shimmer/sparkle looks lovely for evening/night wear. However, for day wear, (under sunlight, offie light, etc.) I need to use the blush quite sparingly. Otherwise, on my mature skin, the shimmer/sparkle of the blush looks unnatural, artificial and unflattering. The second issue is that it is hard to pick up just the bronzer with my designated bronzer brush without getting some blush on it as well. That is frustrating as I I like to use the blush just high on my cheek bones. I am sure there are other smaller bronzer brushes that would fix that problem.
