This looks grey in the compact, but goes on my face perfectly. I barely even have to blend. It looks natural and gives my face definition and shape.

I thought I found a decent match in NYX’s “Taupe” as many an internet source had recommended, but if I’m honest “Taupe” still didn’t quite work with my undertones as it’s applies too orangey/yellow. When I saw Sephora’s “Second Chance” I was instantly drawn to this flattering light blushing taupe shade with a pinky undertone. When I applied it, I was even more impressed. YES SEPHORA! This is what I’ve been looking for! This is a way more natural looking contour (and still buildable for drama) if you find that even the lightest of other brands’ contour/taupe blushes/taupe eye shadows look too warm and “fake”, like an orange/yellow dirt smudge rather than a shadow in the the hollows of your facial structure. If you are an “Ice Queen” searching for something to make those cheekbones pop, give this a try.
