The price is ridiculous (hence the 4 stars), however it is a good product. It is slightly more peach toned but it looks great on everyone. My friends borrow it all the time and love it. It can be used as an everyday natural look, or it can be layered for a show performance look. The packaging is adorable, but I will caution that it takes up a lot of room. The sparkling effect is great and makes the price a bit more worth it. I can use all 3 colours together or individually. Note that the lightest colour is not light enough to use as a highlight for my skin type as advertised. If you have the money it’s worth it, otherwise you could probably invest elsewhere.

It's something you can play around with too, some days I like using a smaller brush on the lightest orange-pink shade as a highlighter on the top of my cheeks. The best thing about this blush of course is the subtle shimmer it comes with that other blushes just don't quite do. However, it is very faint and it doesn't last that long throughout the day even with a setting spray (and my oily skin type) and you can achieve the look that you want with alternative blushes that are much cheaper than this. But overall, it's classic and it's always been one of my favourite too faced products, you can't go wrong with it! <3
