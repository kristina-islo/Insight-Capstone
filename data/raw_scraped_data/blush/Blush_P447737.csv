Glad to get some of the colours that I wouldn't buy in full size, and get a feel for what's available. I think these work well together for a full look with bronzer, blush and highlight. The shades are gorgeous! My few complaints are they they are quite small so it's a little trickier to get a good application than with the full sizes, and they could do with an expanded shade range for these little kits (e.g. a set geared for fair skin, and a set geared for deep skin would be great). I'd suggest to swipe the blush or bronzer onto a brush from the tube and apply it with the brush, rather than straight onto the face, for best application. The highlighter I put onto my fingers and dot onto the cheekbones.

blush,NUDESTIX,NUDESTIX Mini Nudies 3-Piece Kit,beautybyalyssa,Rouge,Rookie,"['Eye Color Brown', 'Hair color Black', 'Skin Tone Medium', 'Skin Type Combination']",4 stars,29 Mar 2020,no,,,A good value set to try Nudestix,"After seeing so many rave reviews of Nudestix, I decided to check out what all the hype is about. So I got this 3-piece kit that features Nudestix’s bestselling Nudies. And I’ve been using them regularly for the past one and half months. Hey, Honey: At first glance, I thought this is too shimmery to be a bronzer and too dark to be a highlighter. But when I actually apply it on my face and blend it out, it gives a radiant glow without emphasizing the appearance of pores. On my medium skin tone (NC30-35), it works the best as a highlighter and lasts about 4 hours. Sweet Peach Peony: I usually don’t wear peachy/coral blushes. As my skin has a warm, yellow undertone, I find that peachy/coral blushes tend to make my complexion more yellowish. So I didn’t expect to love this product. But I was wrong! The Sweet Peach Peony Nudies Bloom provides a look that is reminiscent of a post-workout flush. It looks so natural and beautiful. On my combination/oily skin, the “dewy” formula looks fresh instead of greasy. And it wears about 5 hours on a regular day in the office. Sunkissed: This is probably the bestseller of all bestselling Nudies. Personally, I find it difficult to work with. As a bronzer, it is a bit too coral for my skin tone. As a blush, it looks way too brown for my preference. As an eyeshadow, it creases after 2 hours, even though I don’t have particularly oily eyelids and I always use an eyeshadow primer. After some experiments, I find this works the best as a lipstick. The matte formula doesn’t feel too dry on my lips, and it lasts decently for about 3 hours without eating.

I wear the darker color around the perimeter of the lips, the lighter pink in the inner perimeter and the gold/bronze in the center of the pout. This gives an illusion of fuller lips. They are very creamy, easy to apply and blend. For the checks I like to dot around the area I choose and tap with my fingers not to shift the makeup on my face when blending. They are small and great to fit in my small crossbody bags. Only downfall is that they are not very long lasting. Well priced. I’m attaching pictures for you to envision the actual size and a swatch on my hand.

Let's go over some basic math here. A full sized tube at .25 oz is worth $32. These minis are .07 oz each, so that makes .21 oz in total for the set. So basically you are paying $4.76 more than you normally would for the same amount of product, but in this kit you get 3 different products to contour, highlight, and provide blush. Most companies charge an insane amount more for their minis. The only real difference with the minis is that they do not come with a brush. Now to the actual products themselves. I have tried and love the hey honey highlight. It just gives off a gorgeous glow that is dewy but not sticky. I also love that it is not a chunky glittery mess. The effect is not subtle either. It is noticeable, but can be dialed down a notch if you blend well and apply it in layers. It is also not tacky or sticky which is genius. The blush is one of the dewy ones (they also have a matte version in the full size), but once sheered out and added to the cheeks it tones down the shine and morphs into a natural looking flush. The contour I have never used, but that is only because I really am terrible at applying any contour, so I have avoided that one. This is a pretty good deal overall, and would be amazing for traveling. The container it comes in has a magnifying mirror in it as well, so you are able to apply these on the go. I'm really impressed with the products I've tried in this line so far. They are all amazing quality, and they noticeable on your face, but in a manner that enhances and not distracts.

The highlighter is a pretty golden color and I love to layer a powder highlighter over top to really add a pop of glow!

I have light skin bordering on light-medium in the summer, and each shade here works very well. The highlighter, if used with a light hand, looks like a natural glow (it's hard for me, with older skin, to find a highlighter that isn't too bright or glittery). The blush

The pink is really pretty glow gloss, the su kissed bronze is warm and golden and th traditional matte formula. Hey honey gives a golden glow. The overall look is natural and sunkissed and beachy. I've seen complaints about the small size but honestly I think they are perfect. You don't need to use much and they are lasting super well and it makes them the ideal travel size.

You can blend out any colour to make it more of a tint or build them to get a touch of drama. The shimmer is the best inner corner highlight, and then I use it as a proper highlight by blending out, so it’s less gold and more champagne.

The sweet peach peony color is the perfect peach blush. I’m a die hard Nars Orgasm fan but this color is giving it a run for its money, it gives such a nice flush of color with a dewy shine. At first I was hesitant about the texture, it’s a bit stickier than I’d like but it glides on so easily and it settles into the skin without looking too shiny. The bronze shade is actually not as dark in person than in this photo online, at first I actually thought it was another blush. It’s great for medium toned girls like me, and the best part is that there’s no trace of orange in the color. Out of all three items, the highlighter is my least used because I find I don’t really need highlighter after using the other two products, but I will place a bit in the corner of my eyes. Also pro tip, the bronze stick is excellent as a lip color.

Definitely nice on my light skintone, would definitely not recommend for darker or even medium skin tones, which is unfortunate, I wish they had a few options of combos. But I loved the way it looked using all the products together. Could stand to have the bronzer and more of an actual.. bronzer. It’s super peachy. Ymmv!

You get a reasonable amount of product (the sticks screw up so there is more to it than what is pictured). If you take the product on a brush instead of drawing it on, it will last longer too. These are pigmented so a little goes a long way. Love!!

However the biggest con for me was that the ‘bronzer’ color is more of a blush. At least for me I wouldn’t use it as a bronzer. But it was my favorite color as a blush. Also the actual blush was too light for my medium skin tone unless I really July it up, but again so little product I felt I was wasting it. The highlight is very pretty and natural. Overall, choose your favorite and buy the full size. I love the formulas and plan to buy a full size of sunkissed to use as a blush.

The bronzer gives you a very natural looking tan. I will say the bronzer was a bit tough for me to blend out and then I had to add a few coats to really see it (light to medium skin right now). Once finally blended it was very pretty. Took two stars away because i don’t find these long lasting at all....even with primer. Maybe that’s normal and this is my first time using cream products. I guess I could set it with powder but I think that defeats the purpose of getting the natural looking summer glow. I think adding setting spray would make the whole look too shiny since I have combo skin. The blush is a perfect coral shade and the highlight is Glowy but natural looking: the same thing happened with these though and I ended up reapplying three times in one day. I will find a way to use these up because they’re tiny but will not be purchasing full size. Hope this helps!

I ordered it right away and have only tried out Sunkissed on my cheeks and so far, am happy with how this shade looks on my fair and cool toned complexion. I’m excited to do more experimenting with these. I would call myself a makeup minimalist and don’t wear a lot of it at all- so these small sizes are perfect for me and will likely last awhile, and I love how you don’t need a brush! Don’t let the reviews complaining about the size sway you- if you do the math, these are roughly the same cost per oz than if you were to buy a full size. It’s not a rip off at all but a great convenient way to try out different shades especially if you are new to the brand. Very happy with this purchase!

I will eventually pick up the full sizes as well. They're so great to travel with, user friendly. They can be blended out with fingers, sponges, and brushes. They give you such a natural amount of color to the skin with either a tinted moisturizer or light coverage foundation (that's at least what I wear). The color story works so well together, The bronzer looks a little bit red to me at first, but it is so stunning with the blush. Great for the summer time! The formula also doesn't wear down through out the day either, and I've worn it in 100 F (37 C). I have normal to oily skin, and it looks good on its own, or even powdered. Lastly, the highlighter still shows up and is still beautiful even if you powder your face a little.

I have the Maple one and Sunset Strip (this one is a little patchy). Sun kissed is extremely similar to Deep Maple, but lighter in depth. These are listed as mini but they’re definitely tiny. I do enjoy them. Sun kissed is a pinkish bronzer. The other is a lighter pink. The highlight is pretty. I like that it is more of a beige tone rather than a glaring icy color. I do NOT apply these with my fingers. I use a small brush for the highlight and a small buffing brush for the cheek colors. And DAB them on. Otherwise it can pull at your foundation. They last a few hours and look nice, IMO. I can’t fathom drawing these on my face and blending it in. If the price point was better I’d give 4 stars but there really isn’t much in the tube at all. So I recommend the brand but buy the full size tube.
