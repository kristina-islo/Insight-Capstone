blush,ANTONYM,Antonym Organic Certified Highlighting Blush,LoraBoraMora,Rouge,Rookie,"['Eye Color Brown', 'Hair color Red', 'Skin Tone Fair', 'Skin Type Combination']",5 stars,26 Apr 2019,no,,,Wow!,"Okay, this is my new favourite blush. Its both subtle and very pigmented at the same time. Im very fair, most blushes are a bit clown like on me. This is perfect amount of flush and the added shine is really gorgeous, not over done, just perfectly glowy. The formula is quite soft so you need to use a soft touch, but its really stunning.",1,0,Recommends this product

blush,ANTONYM,Antonym Organic Certified Highlighting Blush,beautymama21,Rouge,Rookie,[],4 stars,1 Sep 2017,no,,,highlighter!,"Love this as a highlighter/luminizer, and that's how I use it most of the time. If I'm in a rush, it works as a pretty blush but the shimmer is a bit much for a blush for me. I have medium-olive undertone skin and it works for me. The staying power isn't great unless you set it, and looks like just shimmer and no color after a sweaty work out. I'm willing to deal since it's an organic brand.",32,10,Recommends this product
