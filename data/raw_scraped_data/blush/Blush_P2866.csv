The color is very sheer. It showed on my eyelids well, but as blush I had to put on about 3 applications for the color to be more pronounced. But the deal breaker was putting it on my lips. It felt dry and chalky on my lips, was incredibly sheer and almost looked cartoonish as I applied more layers to build color. I would be considered ""deep"" under the Sephora complexion profile, but I was suprised that I had to do so much for so little ""pop"". Disappointed, but will try other colors down the road.

This is officially the blush that will always be in my makeup bag. By far the smoothest, easiest-to-apply cream blush I've tried, and it's so easy to keep it very natural looking (which I find more difficult with the powder version) or ramp up the color if you want it to be bolder. The shimmer is absolutely perfect - it's not over-the-top, more of a glow than a shimmer, and I don't need to apply highlighter when I wear this. Overall, completely worth the hype and will repurchase forever.

Forty dollars sounds like a lot at first, but the multiple is named that for a reason, and that is that it has multiple uses!! Aduhhh.

I usually like to test out different formulas and don’t often purchase multiple shades of one product, but this was so good that I bought it in South Beach, Na Pali Coast, and Portofino. They never disturb any foundation underneath, and blend out so easily to give a gorgeous non-sticky, soft sheen to the cheeks. I love that I can apply the stick directly to my cheeks without picking up my base and I don’t even need a brush or sponge to blend it, it takes seconds with my fingers. South Beach can be used as a pretty peachy-nude blush or a natural bronzer on my pale skin, while the other two are pigmented but natural dusty coral-pink blushes. I don’t even need to wear highlighter when I use these! If you want easy application, glow, and a natural but colorful flush, definitely try these out. Expensive, but worth it for holy grail status.

A bit of clarity though. It’s not shimmery like Orgasm but it’s not a flat or drab matte either. And it’s definitely not coral. On my fair complexion with neutral undertones it’s more of a warm browny pink which I’m cool with. It looks great by itself, or dabbed over other colors. If you use it on your eyes, I highly recommend an eye primer first. It makes for a gorgeous crease color. On me it’s an MLBB shade in place of lipstick but I need to wear it under some lip oil or balm for comfort.

This is not quite the color I was hoping for- it’s more pink than peach- but it still works. It’s also not that “shimmery”, especially compared to Orgasm. This barely has any shimmer at all.

First of all, like many people mentioned already, it's very shimmery. As someone who wanted this more as a blush than a highlighter, I was disappointed when the pigmentation mostly disappeared into a sheen after blending it with my fingers. Also, the first time I applied this on my face, I applied way too much pressure and it totally dented the top of the stick. I'm used to the Glossier Haloscope formula, which is much more dense/robust and actually is much less glittery than The Multiple. I love the shade that I purchased (Orgasm - such an iconic color), but the texture and the amount of shimmer was just not what I was looking for.

For lips it is a tad light for me, but I like the tiny bit of color it gives just for a different look. This little stick lasts all day on the cheeks and eyes. I am going to order in another color!

I bought this because I love the blush in this color so much that I thought I would give this a try. Let me tell you: it's too much. It's a very hard product to use - even if you wanted to apply it on your cheekbones as a highlighter - the color looks weird in that way. I used it as a liquid blush type of situation, and the combination of the shimmer and the reflection that the cream consistency gives off was just too much.

The color was beautiful - a nice coral shade - but the shimmer is almost too much for cheeks. It also does not blend well on dry skin. I tried fingers, beauty blender (dry and damp) and a brush and nothing really helped with blending. I got best results with a damp blender but the results were less than stellar. I bought a similar version of this product from another brand with much better results. Overall I would not buy this again, especially at this price point.
