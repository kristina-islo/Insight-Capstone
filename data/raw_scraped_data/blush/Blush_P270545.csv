I’ve been using this for years and it is absolutely stunning. I get compliments on my glowing skin every single time. It’s not sparkly, leaves a beautiful glow, and the powder is smooth. However, every single one I’ve owned has broken within a month. I’m not dropping or traveling with this product. I think the powder is so soft that it eventually crumbles. Such a shame because it is expensive! I need to find a replacement product that doesn’t break.

When I first started using the product I felt like I wasn’t getting that much pay off but I figured maybe you just have to get into it some more and then it will apply better. It’s mostly just glitter not really a “glow”. But the worst thing I experience was when I traveled with it. I packed in into my makeup bag in my checked bag and when I got to my destination it was destroyed all the bars and highlight had moved around in the package. So I gently moved them back only the bottom bar was crushed. So the next time I had to board the plane I carried it in my purse hoping if I was careful it would not get mixed up again. But of course when I got to our hotel and checked it was all mixed up and crushed looking. So to fix this issue I moved the pieces back in place and folded a couple tissues and set them on top of the makeup and then stored in my purse for the next plane ride. Once I got home I checked and everything was still in place! I do not recommend traveling with this product because it breaks so easy unless you fill it with tissue. Other then that the product is okay but not the amazing glow I was hoping to get for the $50 I spent on it.

blush,BOBBI BROWN,Bobbi Brown Shimmer Brick Highlighter,KaySuze,,,[],5 stars,12 Jun 2017,no,,,Color: Bronze,"I bought the travel size in the store over a year ago and still have a decent amount left after using it almost everyday. I decided to go ahead and get the full size and use the small one exclusively for travel. I have the bronze color (olive skin tone that is more fair in the winter and tan in the summer) and it is a perfect bronzer. It adds a nice highlight and bronze, but can also be used as a blush on minimal makeup days. I've even used a swipe as eyeshadow.

This product gives the perfect subtle glow you can wear to work without looking like you're heading to a club or making you appear older due to highlighting fine lines. I've used it for years and never had one crack as others have mentioned but I do my makeup at home. I use the Rose as a blush and love it

It's great as a highlighter over some bronzer. I also use it on my eyelids. I like this color for summer. My main issue is that you're mostly paying for the Bobbie Brown name. I think this particular item is insanely overpriced. You can find similar colors and textures that are much better prices. I still like the product and I'll continue using it all summer but I won't be repurchasing.

Their gradient offers some option for using some lighter shimmer in some spots or darker shimmer in others. They last a decent amount of time; only have to reapply twice in a day.

If I want my highlight to be a more turnt up but not Becca turnt up. This is it. However, this shimmer break will always break. There's a reason why other companies don't often do this brick format. The colors are beautiful. But I've had these BB bricks since I was in high school and always have terrible memories of it shattering all over my bag. So unless you wear your makeup not on the go, and just swipe it at home perhaps this will be for you. I'm just so disappointed with how long this product has been out in the market and yet the design is still faulty.

Maybe my 'look' these days is fewer products with better impact or maybe this effect is more sheen than dew, but I'm not getting a lot of use from this especially given the price tag. When I do use, the sheen borders on greasy/ oily looking.

Honestly, I first bought it after Prince William and Catherine's wedding when I found out that she wore it on her big day. I loved how her makeup looked and immediately ordered the shade she wore -- Pink Quartz. I was not disappointed when I tried it for myself. I have this in two colours -- Pink Quartz and Beige(from BB Online). To use, I sweep my blush brush over the entire brick, getting a little of each colour, and then dust it over my face. The result is an air brushed finish. My pores and fine lines are blurred away and I am left with a healthy glow. This is not a glittery ""going to the club"" shimmer at all, but an illuminated ""lit from within"" finish. In the past I have used Josie Maran's Argan Enlightenment Illuminizing Veil and Laura Mercier Matt Radiance Baked Powder. I like this so much better! This gives a warmth to the skin that other highlighting powders don't. I have one of these makeup bricks with me at all times for touch-ups. They are awesome and foolproof!
