I normally use the Tarte blush so I was a little scared to stray but this is everything I wanted and more. It has a beautiful coral pinky hue as described. It is similar to Nars Orgasm but more coral. It also has quite of bit of shine that I don’t even both with highlighter when I’m trying to do a simple look which definitely works for me! It’s almost like a 2 in 1. I had so many messages from people asking me about it after the first time I wore it, it is such a beautiful shade. Wears beautifully and doesn’t make me break out. Would definitely buy again.

I’ve been using Nars Torrid for 20 years and wanted to go with a clean blush, so I decided to give RMS a try. I got the Crushed Rose color. This is my first RMS product, and I’m very pleased. The color is very pigmented, and for a sun-kissed look, I just tap my blush brush on it a few times to pick up the color, then tap the apple of my cheeks, bit on my nose, and very top of forehead. It looks like a bit of a sunburn that will soon turn into a tan. I just love it! The color is very much like Nars Torrid, and I think it has just as much if not better staying power. The best part is that it is clean, and I’m trying to switch to all green products. Will definitely give other RMS items a try. The compact itself is a little bit hard to open, but I’ve only had it a couple days. I think it’ll loosen up a bit the more I use it. Give this blush a try!

It’s not as shimmery as Nars orgasm, which I like. It applies very Sheer, light so that you could use it as a highlighter. To get a decent amount on, you do need a few layers if your using a blush brush that lightly picks up product. You definitely would have to experiment regarding the right brush to use if you wanted to pick up more pigment instantaneously and not have to build it up. I wanted a blush that didn’t have talc in it anymore that was my main priority as well as a color that suits me I don’t do well with pinks so this fit the bill and it was really hard actually to find a brush that doesn’t have talc or or synthetic Fluorophoghite. It does last well too.

Worst part the blush isn’t matte there’s a sheen to it so it looks like I put highlighter over my blush which I HATE, not a flex but I have relatively nice skin and I feel like this blush accented my skin in a really unflattering way that made me self conscious and think my skin was bad! It’s not one star because you do get a good amount of product for the price.

I would have thought it would be too intense on my fair skin, but it is actually incredibly natural-looking and flattering. It is very pigmented and a very little bit goes a long way. The only downside is that it is pretty fragile because it is so soft - I took lost angel traveling and it totally shattered. Luckily, I was able to put it in a loose powder container and it works great that way.

I love layering with Lost Angel, using Lost Angel at the top as the cheekbone as a highlighter, and then very lightly all over Crushed Rose. Im really liking these rms pressed blushes, they go on very easily and blend out perfectly. They look slightly radiant, but not overly glittery, and can be easily built up. I got all three, and use Moon Cry as an eyeshadow, and as a contour, but with a very light hand. I though that would be the one I would use the least, but its the one I am using daily. Very happy with these guys, was hesitant about buying all three, but am glad I did! The one negative I have noticed is that Lost Angel is a bit dry in the pan, and needs a bit more blending out to look natural. But it also looks beautiful as an eyeshadow since it is a bit more heavy.

MAC had a color called Bikini Blush that I remember had a similar remarkable ability to adjust so well with such a beautiful color highlighting the face and flushing the skin.
