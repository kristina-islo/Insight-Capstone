blush,NUDESTIX,NUDESTIX Nude + Red Hot Lips 3-Piece Mini Set,RollingTider,Rouge,Rookie,"['Hair color Brunette', 'Skin Tone Light', 'Skin Type Combination']",4 stars,8 Jan 2020,no,,,2/3 ain’t bad,"Love the mirrored box, which is perfect for tossing in your bag and using for touch ups. I found the Royal crayon to be dry and not the right tone for my cool complexion, but the Posh gloss and Nude 04 were terrific, and I will definitely rebuy both of them when these smaller versions run out. If budget is an issue, skip the Posh gloss for a cheaper version, but get the Nude 04 crayon.",10,0,Recommends this product

I purchased this lip kit and love it. I would have given it 5 stars but Royal is not a color I would ever wear. I love Posh lip balm. It’s a great nude color and I really like the lip gloss too. Slightly minty tingle and great color. I’ll definitely buy the full sizes of these two. I’ll also get Nude 6 lip gloss as well.,5,1,Recommends this product
