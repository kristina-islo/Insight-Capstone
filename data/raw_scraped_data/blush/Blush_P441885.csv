You only need a little bit and this color gives you the perfect sun kissed cheeks. I also love the highlighter. It’s not too intense but gives a pretty glow.

I am here to say that I absolutely love this duo and provide my experience to help out some others (I purchased contrachroma. I am fair with olive undertones). I am shocked at some of the negative reviews because the formula is beautiful. The blush looks exactly like a natural sunburn look and the highlight is what I would consider a grown up highlight- subtle but stunning. I am seeing a lot of reviews that make it seem like there is a discrepancy of product quality which really saddens me. If you are on the fence about purchasing just be aware of what the product is meant to do and adjust expectations accordingly. It is worth the shot to give it a try because if your quality is like mine then you will be more than happy.

I really like Contrachroma as a neutral--it adds luminosity and dimension and makes a nice counterpoint to a bright lip. There's a bit of kick-up (i.e. a loose burst of product when you pass your brush over the surface) --annoying but workable. Now a caveat: Sephora is a reliable source for Kosas stuff and I'd rely on them for the following reason: I recently ordered directly from the company (they had a $20-off blush sale) and, on receiving the product, it became apparent that they were trying to shift old stock (hence, the sale). The quality was different (really loose and chalky), the compact was different, and the expiry label read 18 months, as opposed to 6 months. It seemed a bit iffy to me and put a sour taste in my mouth for the brand in general.

I have light medium olive skin and C HI blush i could sheer out and get that sunburnt mauvy look but the highlighter was too dark so i used it as topper. Also reason why i got HI bec online swatches the regular one looks lighter than tropic equinox and i wanted something darker but i prolly should ve gotten regular one instead. I use mostly kosas cream blushes so i didnt know the kickback on their powders are insane literally flying everywhere so make sure to be gentle, and blend on your arm first before applyin on face bec its super pigmented.

I have the shade Longitude Zero and while the blush is really nice, the highlighter is probably the worst I've ever tried. It just does not leave a nice finish on the skin. I would not say the highlight is glittery but when blended it does leave particles of chunky shimmer just sitting on top of the skin. It has a very subtle pink-ish sheen that I don't find to be buildable. I can't speak to the other shades but the Longitude Zero highlight is a dud. The Longitude Zero blush is really pretty and has nice pigmentation. It is matte but not a super flat matte. I think the finish is gorgeous. If both the blush and the highlight were great, it would be worth the money. But I'm not sure it's worth it for the blush only.
