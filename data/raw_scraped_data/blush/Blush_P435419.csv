I have two colors the Momoko peach colored one and the one that is tan like a bronzer. The Momoko is beautiful! It’s just the right amount of orange for my medium olive skin tone. I also have worn this in the winter when I am super pale and it still looks amazing. I know a lot of people have complained about the size but They must be walking around looking like clowns because I literally just barely dab my blush brush In the pot to where there is hardly any product on the bristles and that is enough color for your cheek. One little pot lasted me over five months easy. And the formula being that it is whipped to powder is sooooo easy for application and blending. Oat better than straight powder.

When I put it on, I could not believe how much more ""alive"" I looked with only a flash of color on my cheeks. And it looked so natural.

Sayoko is a beautiful Kremlin red that looks good when applied faintly for that flush blush effect. Sonoya is also a beautiful shade. I received that one as a sample and it actually looked pretty nice on me. I feel that Sonoya can wear lightly and built up. So to sum it up, beautiful colors that are light weight with a very faint hint of shimmer but are a little challenging to apply due to the airy mousse-like texture.

My skin tone is similar to Beyoncé or Halle Berry. I have a neutral undertone. My two favorites were Sayoko/red (bold) and Sonoya/warm pink (subtle). I usually avoid pink hues in blush and lipstick because they look too light/fake against my skin tone. Sonoya was deep enough that it looked natural-more rosey than pink... if that makes sense. The red shade, Sayoko, was natural looking, just more saturated/intense. I really like the texture of this blush. East to apply and easy to layer. Decent longevity as well. Description says these are matte but there’s definitely shimmer/glitter in this product. Even though the shimmer was very subtle, for me, it was a dealbreaker. I’m looking for an everyday basic blush and glitter/shimmer is not part of an everyday look for me. Maybe I’m old, or boring... probably both; if I decide to break out of my minimalist shell and get a second blush for “going out” this whipped powder blush would be top of my list. (I’d probably go with the more subtle Sonoya shade over the Sayoko (deep red)... baby steps.) (Side note- I ended up going with Benefit Benetint lip and cheek stain- completely different texture but no shimmer and the color is... awesome.)

This has a fluffy, mousse like texture that goes on so smoothly. It’s versatile in that you can lightly apply it for a natural flush or go more heavy handed for more saturation. Personally, I like the whole “no make up” makeup look so I apply this on the apples of my cheeks with my finger and I get such a beautiful, smooth application. Doesn’t catch or cling to dry spots/textures. I have acne prone, sensitive skin and normally silicones tear my skin up. But not with this! I’d imagine that this will last a long time cause a little goes a long way. For reference, my complexion is around Rihanna and I wear 360 in Synchro Self Refreshing foundation and this looks so bomb!! Lasts all day too.

Got the ayao and setsuko. Love both of these colors, but especially loving the ayao color for winter right now as I’ve been searching for a good plum color for a long time. Ayao is so nice on my fair Asian skin! I love the rosy color of setsuko too, but it is more pink which I’d prefer more to use once it becomes spring/summer. Hoping to get more colors in this blush! So easy to use and pigmented! Love the color selection too.

I’ve been brand loyal to Nars blushes for over a decade, so it’s saying something that I found a blush I actually think might be better. I feel bad saying that. I didn’t mean it Nars, I love you both. I apply this by lightly pressing my index and middle finger in the pot, and dabbing out the color where I want it on my cheeks. I start out with almost no product but of course can add if the color is too light. I keep using my fingers, which melts the product into my cheeks, gently dabbing until the area and color intensity look about right. Then I come in with a blush brush to just make sure the color is evenly distributed. You really get such a beautiful soft flush with this. Can’t recommend it enough.

The formula is also incredible. U can apply either your fingers and it blends out seamlessly but I do prefer to apply it with a small stippling brush. Even if you pick up too much, the color blends out naturally. The color pay off is definitely there. The formula does not lift the foundation underneath and works really well over powders as well. Truly a great formula. And the packaging is also very nice and doesn’t look cheap.

I used it as a bronzer, shadow, and even to give a golden touch to my lips and I was In love with how well it blended, it dries beautifully, and it has such a smooth matte finish! It made my skin look health and with some sunshine on it. I can’t wait to try the blush colors too. I have large pores and some texture and this is the first bronzer that actually helped me achieve a glass skin tan/glow with a matte finish. I highly recommend it.

I use this on bear skin with no primer and still lasted me six hours. It has very fine micro shimmer in case you were wondering. But overall, the blush looks natural and applies and blends so easily! You don’t need much of the product for it to be visible or well at least on my light to medium olive skin tone. I love it! I use it almost everyday.",50,3,Recommends this product
