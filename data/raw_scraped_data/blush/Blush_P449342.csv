blush,TOWER 28 BEAUTY,Tower 28 Beauty BeachPlease Tinted Lip + Cheek Balm,JinyunZ,Insider,Rookie,"['Eye Color Brown', 'Hair color Black', 'Skin Tone Light', 'Skin Type Combination']",4 stars,3 h ago,no,Color: Magic Hour,https://www.sephora.com/productimages/sku/s2284875+sw.jpg,"perfect color, not long-lasting","Magic hour is a gorgeous and flattering rosy color that for me, looks more pink than orangey as other reviewers had mentioned. A little does go a long way but the color quickly fades and becomes barely noticeable after a brief few hours. It does leave a slightly dewy look on the cheeks even after the color fades. Not sure if that’s because of my oily skin, but reapplying the color is easy albeit a minor inconvenience. I’ve been using this product for a while and have never broken out or had any reactions to it.

Though I can only speak to Magic Hour, if you’re looking for an alternative to the sheer goodness of Fenty’s new blushes, you’re in luck. I dipped my brush into this pan just once, and had more than enough product to blush up both sides of my face. This product is beyond pigmented, but so smooth and easy to apply. The texture is creepy, but it sets on the skin and doesn’t feel tacky. One star off simply because Magic Hour isn’t the best shade for me - I like a bit of color contrast on my skin, and this definitely comes off peachy & monochromatic. That being said, I can’t wait to try this in another shade!

The formula is so unique on these and I feel like they're foolproof to use. They blend out seamlessly onto the cheeks using either a beautyblender or a slightly denser brush, they dry down without feeling sticky or tacky, and the lasting power is surprisingly long. Even for someone who doesn't have a lot of experience using cream products, these are a dream to work with and create such a beautiful look. The color can easily be built up or sheered out and I never have a problem with it looking unnatural or patchy. These are absolute perfection and I can't get enough! Don't hesitate to try these, especially for the price; money well-spent, can't recommend highly enough.

It does not. Very Popular remained a true dusty rose. The shade Magic Hour by Tower 28 pulls something similar to a pale lilac-pink on my skin. Overall, I don't mind the formula. It initially felt more like a lip gloss but dried down fine. It didn't remain sticky or tacky after it dried. It did not disrupt my tinted moisturizer base. Wear time wasn't the best. Being that it is such a pale/light color, on my currently tanned skin, that is likely why it was more noticeably absent by hour four. I do like the formula enough that I'm going to try it in a different color. I'm giving it 3 stars instead of 4 because the packaging is a bit of an annoyance to open. The container is quite stiff to move and when I was able to pry it open I'd ended up getting my fingers in the product. I suppose it is better than having the lid flopping around all willy nilly. But still an annoyance nonetheless.

I’m a Fenty 420, Lancôme 500, too faced Chai and all colors are great.. if you are darker then Magic hour will just appear to be a peachy dewy highlight . Coming from someone who grew up hating cream products because they would be greasy, slide all over the face and take off makeup while blending.. these are opposite! I love how makeup companies are getting more scientifically advanced because these cream products are improving for the better. These can go into of my full beat faves without taking off my makeup and over my bare face as a gooey blush. It glides over my skin texture and acne unlike powder highlights, and it STAYS PUT!! Wherever you lay this blush, even though it’s a cream it stays out. It won’t transfer all over your face or cheek. The formula is dewy but not like a thin dewy.. I honestly hate dewy formulas because they rub off so quick even with powder but this formula is a thick, touch cream.. I thick it’s because they add powder to it to make it a thick formula that stays out. These blushes make my cheekbones pop so much because of the glow it gives, I keep my whole face matte and add these to my cheeks.. my cheeks are so defined and glowy because of the contrast. I wore these in the Caribbean a month ago and they didn’t travel around my face in the heat!! They didn’t melt off or act like Vaseline or lipstick(I hate those formulas) . Dark skin people looking for cream blushes that don’t rub off like this lipstick, creamy formulas..!! Buy!! Oily and textured skin people!! These float over acne and texture and are not oily or clogging!! The formula is like now other!! If you are scared to try a cream product, TRY THESE!!

It’s just ok. The formula was thicker than I expected. It blended well, but I’m on the fence if it’s as amazing as a lot of people seem to claim. It’s really really hard to open, which is frustrating. It may end up sitting in a drawer just cause of that. It’s a beautiful color though, and will bring some life to your face.",1,1,

I love cream blush, because it looks like skin is naturally luminous, as if after a workout. This stuff makes my cheeks looks painted like a doll’s — even the tiniest amount has a lot of pigment. Not for people who are into the movie makeup’ dewy look. If a burgundy/plum/wine shade could be added, maybe I’ll give it another try, but the peachy girly pepto bismol undertones are just too artificial-looking.

A clean beauty blush that is EVERYTHING I look for! The Happy Hour color seriously PACKS a punch of COLOR! I was a little surprised when I first tried it (Let's just say you can use a lighter hand than you might expect if you're used to working with other clean beauty blushes that are a whole lot waxier!) Formula is very creamy, great for lips and not too sticky! ☺️ My FAV part about it is the PACKAGING though! It can be a little hard to open BUT so worth it because this is *solid plastic*... which means absolutely NO metal tray at the bottom!!! To ALL my fellow sensitive skin ladies out there with nickle or metal allergies, you CAN FINALLY use an ENTIRE product without those breakouts that come when you hit pan!!!!
