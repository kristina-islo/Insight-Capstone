This magical stuff zhuzhes my light skin from sallow to a healthy glow. I have combination skin & don’t wear foundation; I use it on my cheek-hollows (dry) & it doesn’t dry the skin there or emphasize my peach-fuzz, & on my nose (oily) & it matters the greasy shine down to a satin glow & makes my pores appear less obvious. I blend all but the darkest colour at the top, as it is too dark for my complexion & just makes my skin look muddy. One of my top 2 essentials!

blush,LAURA MERCIER,Laura Mercier Shimmer Bloc,IciclePop,Rouge,Rookie,"['Eye Color Brown', 'Hair color Brunette', 'Skin Tone Light', 'Skin Type Dry']",4 stars,18 Jul 2018,no,,,,"Laura Mercier is my favorite brand for highlighters. I use this shimmer bloc in the winter, since I think the pink tones of this compact look better on pale winter skin than a lot of the golden toned highlighters out there. I like to use this on the inner corner of my eye, lower lash line, and on my brow bone, because I can use a smaller brush to pick up one color. This doesn't work as well for an all over cheek highlight, because if you use a bigger brush it's going to pick up all the colors. I mean, you can do that, it's just not what I prefer.

blush,LAURA MERCIER,Laura Mercier Shimmer Bloc,giag6,,,[],5 stars,10 Apr 2017,no,,,Amazing!!!,"Lately I have been obsessed with the highlighting trend. I watch every YouTube video about highlights I read every review on highlights and I own probably about 20 or more. Lately I have been on a mission to find the brightest most pigmented highlighter so I have been testing them all. After spending a fortune at Sephora this weekend I realized that none of the new highlighters were making me happy so I decided to go through my make up collection and go through everything I own I mean stuff from 2016 to stuff from 2005. And I found an unopened golden shimmer bloc from I would at least say 10 years or more. I put it on a fantail brush and thought in my head why have I not been using this Laura Mercier product when half of my make up collection is Laura Mercier why did I stop using that shimmer bloc?? I also like to think I was way ahead of this highlighting trend because this was at least 10 years old I guess I somehow got away from doing my highlight routine. This morning I tried to amp it up a little I took my fantail brush swirled it around all the colors in the golden shimmer then sprayed my brush with NYX Matte setting spray before applying it to my cheekbone and omfg my cheeks are blinding they look like the sun amazing it's the perfect blend of colors I find with most highlighters they just don't work right with my undertone the Laura Mercier looks amazing on pale skin on olive skin tan skin on all skin with mixing all the colors around it just makes this amazing multi tonal color. I am going to Sephora today to get the other two colors I do remember using the pink one back in the day about 10 years ago and I liked it as a blush highlighter all in 1 and I always thought the gold one was going to be too dark on me but if you swirl it all together it goes perfect on any skin tone. Take it from a girl who has tried every single brand highlighter my boyfriend must want to kill me because lately that is all I've been talking about is highlighters soon as I mention one I think his eyes already start rolling in his head but I must say this shimmer bloc is number one I highly highly recommend...

blush,LAURA MERCIER,Laura Mercier Shimmer Bloc,sunny505,,,"['Age 45-54', 'Skin Type Combination', 'Skin Tone Fair', 'Eye Color Green']",5 stars,2 Feb 2017,no,,,Pefect Highlight,"Ok Ladies, if you are confused about highlighter this one makes it SO simple! Just swirl a blush brush throughout the colors and it produces a beautiful multi dimentional glow on your cheeks. I am 45. I absolutely hate when I see women of any age with streaky, white, ultra glowy highlighters on that makes their skin look shiny and greasy. This one doesn't do that! It looks so natural and it is so simple to apply. I use the Pink mosaic (fair skin, dark hair, green eyes) and it is perfect. I use it just like a blush. No more 2 steps applying blush and then a highlighter on top and wondering where the highlighter should go. This one combines two steps and with one easy step you look perfect. It also builds easily for occasions when you want a more dramatic look. I use it lightly for an everyday look and I love it. I was a long time fan of Nars orgasm and Nars blushes in general. This one is far superior in my opinion and lasts all day. I have replaced all of my Nars blushes and Becca, and Hourglass highlighters with this one. It is all you need!

blush,LAURA MERCIER,Laura Mercier Shimmer Bloc,Amar224,,,[],5 stars,14 Sep 2016,no,,,Perfect :),"I disturbingly own 3 of these (golden mosaic, peach mosaic, and tbe discontinued mosaic). I love them all and I am incredibly happy with this product. These function great as a highlighter with a nice sheen and no glitter. They aren't crazy intense (nor are they subtle), but they can be built up. They also work great as an eyeshadow for a light wash of color on the lid. These are extremely versatile. For example, Peach mosaic alone can be used with great variety- the pink and peach as a blush topper, the copper as a bronze topper, the white as a highlighter that gives a ""wet"" look. This is a great place to start if you are looking for a highlighter.

I've used both palettes on my cheeks and eyes and really love them. How have I not come across these before. I think they'll be perfect when I travel and won't have to bring lots of different products. They do tend to kick up a lot of powder but I'll overlook that because I love them so much.

It's subtle, but does so much at the same time. I am light to medium with yellow undertones. I use it as a highlighter and blush. It does break if you're not careful, so be extra careful. It is very finely milled, and the deposit is pretty amazing. Personally, it's hard for me to find the perfect pink blush that makes me look flushed, healthy, glow-y and natural looking, but this takes the cake! Worth it until I can find something a little more affordable.

It is simply perfect. I do believe that a dense brush helps to pick up the product. It is quite tightly packed, so when I use a soft cheek brush it does not perform so well.

The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because mine broke apart from being in my bag. It wasn't roughly handled or anything - all my other compacts were fine.

L Mercier has a way you can apply them separately. I love the shimmers because they are not scandalous. They stay from day to night. I usually do the pinks for day and the darker ones for night out. It doesn't fall. It stays where you applied it. Highly recommend it.

blush,LAURA MERCIER,Laura Mercier Shimmer Bloc,Jules2424,,,['Age 18-24'],4 stars,10 Jun 2014,no,,,Gorgeous...and fragile.,"I will start out by saying that this is the most beautiful highlight I have ever used. I used the peach shade, but my friends with pale skin have worn the original Mosaic and it is INCREDIBLE. Knocks Kevin Aucoin celestial powder in candlelight out of the cosmetic ballpark. Finely milled, glowy but never overly shimmery, the product is perfection when it is in one piece. That being said, mine shattered as did those of two other friends of mine. No dropping on the ground.. they just broke for no reason. After that, it was unusable. Thanks to Sephora's excellent return policy, I was able to return it sans packaging and receipt. I will repurchase in the future, but not for a while as it is such a high maintenance product and in no way travel friendly.

I am very light-skinned with pink undertones, blonde hair, and blue eyes. Due to the overall fairness and pink in my skin, I have never been able to wear blush without looking “overdone.” I love the flushed look you always see in make-up ads, however, so I tried numerous blushes, bronzers, illuminators, shimmer bricks, etc. Unfortunately, everything was too dark, completely unnoticeable, or glittery and unnatural looking. I found the Laura Mercier Shimmer Bloc at Sephora and fell in love the moment the consultant put it on my face! I went with Pink Mosaic, which gave me that naturally “flushed” look without the obviousness of wearing anything. I like my make-up very natural – neutral eye shadows, black mascara & eyeliner, light blush, etc. – and this product nails it! A lot of shimmer products contain glitter, which I personally don’t care for, but the Laura Mercier Shimmer Bloc has a pearl/iridescent effect that creates a healthy glow. The color is buildable too, so, if you want more, you can easily make it a full-on blush. It’s truly an incredible product, absolutely everything I was looking for, and I hope they never discontinue it!

blush,LAURA MERCIER,Laura Mercier Shimmer Bloc,Bakkerle,,,"['Age 18-24', 'Skin Type Combination', 'Skin Tone Light', 'Eye Color Blue']",5 stars,22 May 2014,no,,,Gorgeous Glow,"I recently saw this product in my local sephora store and fell in love. The picture online does not do the gorgeous shimmer and glow that you see in person any justice. I saw reviews that it had streaky application, but I disagree. The product blends nicely but you must take the time to do so to get a more natural finish. Although, I do have one strong warning. It's very easy to overdo it because the shimmer bloc does have a lot of shimmer, so use a light hand when applying. The pigmentation isn't too overwhelming and the shimmer gives you a beautiful glow, which is perfect for the summer months!
