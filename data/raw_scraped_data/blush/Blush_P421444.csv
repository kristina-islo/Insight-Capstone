I have dry and dehydrated cheeks and this just disappears within a couple hours. I’ve tried it with different primers and on bare face but it’s all the same. The colour and finish are lovely and natural, but, for the price, considering the longevity it’s really not worth it. Speaking of the hefty price tag, the lilah b. on the top lid was already half erased after a few uses with cleans hands which is really ridiculous at this price. I know it works great for some, but maybe not if your skin type is on the drier side.

Yes the packaging is well designed, aesthetically impressive, and hefty. It's also not much bigger than a quarter. For the price alone that was a bit of a shock when I unboxed it, but hoped it's performance would match the rave reviews I've seen for so long. But it blends away into practically nothing, and wears off practically by the time I finish my makeup. Using lipstick as cream blush is far more effective honestly. And this doesn't come close to how beautifully and seamlessly the Nars liquid blush performs. Was also surprised to see that this was formulated with coconut oil. Would've avoided from the get go if I was aware of that prior to purchase. Needless to say I'll be returning.

I was debating a lot about getting it since it is so expensive and not a lot of product...I got this and the Ilia multi stick to try them both and decide. I definitely like the Liliah B one better. The color is more rich and vibrant, it is thicker, more matte and lasts longer. I can see why some people say it is drying on the lips, but I always have a balm underneath anyways, and the color stays very well because it is matte and not so wet. The Ilia stick is definitely more wet and fades much faster. The pigmentation isn't as good either. Then can we talk about the packaging??? So beautiful. I read that it was heavy packaging, but I was still surprised HOW heavy it was when I picked it up. But honestly, I love it - they just don't make packaging and compacts like this anymore. Yes it is small and half as much product as the Ilia stick, but I had to apply way less of this product and it lasted much longer.

I had a blush this size from a Japanese pharmacy before (also double duty) but it cost a fourth of this one and it lasted between 1-2 months. For the price tag of Lilah B it’s just not worth it. The color is gorgeous but the payoff isn’t as great as I would have liked and it’s too dry for the lips. I have normal-oily skin, so it works on the cheeks, but that alone is just not enough to justify the price tag. I would happily use it if it was $15 and the 2 stars are for the cute packaging, but that’s all the product has going for it.

Subtle on lips and eyes too. For lips, I use it over my lip balm because it’s kind of drying. It’s kind of small for what you get and I do wish that this could be refilled, like KW’s Cream Blush.

I love how there's no trace of shimmer or glitter, which I tend to avoid to achieve that totally natural look. I purchased the color Lilah B., which I dab lightly onto my cheeks to complete my face. It makes me look just the slightest bit flushed, totally youthful and glowing. It did take me a couple applications to get it perfect, but at this point I couldn't imagine not having it in my arsenal.

I'm always running around everywhere and it's super handy to have this little pebble with me wherever I go so i can touch up my lips and my cheeks throughout the day. The formula is amazing- it's not cakey, goes on smooth and is super buildable. I bought one in every shade! When applying it on my cheeks it gives a really natural from within flush. The little pebble is so cute and chic i love pulling it out of my purse or clutch.

blush,LILAH B.,lilah b. Divine Duo™ Lip & Cheek,lavendercatty,,,"['Age 35-44', 'Skin Tone Light', 'Eye Color Brown']",4 stars,20 Jul 2017,no,,,Love lilah b.'s double duty products!,"This is the 2nd double duty product that I've tried from lilah b. (the other is the concealer/eye primer). I tried the shade b. real and it is the perfect flush to add on to my cheeks. It also lays well on top of their flawless foundation because I thought the creamy consistency would cake on top of a powder but it didn't! I've also tried this on my lips which turns more milky and light. Love the small pebble like packaging that I can just toss in my bag to take it with me for touch-ups.

blush,LILAH B.,lilah b. Divine Duo™ Lip & Cheek,Sunnysmom,,,[],5 stars,11 Jul 2017,no,,,"love this line, amazing products!","So excited to see this at Sephora. I have the red and burgundy and they are so beautiful. Both apply easily with a very non-intrusive pleasant smell. They sheer out as well as can be deepened with more application and they give a lovely flush of translucent color on cheek and lip. Texture is perfect. Though it looks small a little goes a very long way. Don't be afraid of the bold colors as you will love them! Also love the eye shadows- very smooth, and like the cheek and lip they give a beautiful wash of translucent color. The packaging is amazing- very solid and like a little piece of art. So happy to see Sephora getting into these lines!
