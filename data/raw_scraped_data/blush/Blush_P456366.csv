It’s the perfect blush that doesn’t look fake and too pink like so many blushes out there. It gives a really nice natural flush.,1,2,Recommends this product
blush,BENEFIT COSMETICS,Benefit Cosmetics Dallas Blush Mini,RavenNYC,VIB,Rookie,"['Eye Color Brown', 'Hair color Brunette', 'Skin Tone Olive', 'Skin Type Normal']",1 star,24 Mar 2020,no,,,Old Dallas was a great alternative for a bronzer,"This doesn’t show up and is not soft enough. When I first saw the old Dallas, I said this is unique and great of Benefit. I work with many Olive skintones and most bronzers can get muddy. Many also come from countries that don’t use bronzer, who knows how long heavy bronzers will trend, so I always used the old Dallas because it was a bronzer/blush and then used a little blush on the high points. It also had a little bit of a rosy tint that looked like a natural glow, unlike red tints or blushes. It was so genius.

Why “bring back” beloved products that aren’t the same products? Especially when the new products are inferior? This is not at all the “outdoorsy flush” that Dallas used to be. It’s a dull ordinary highlighter that’s too light to be even a bronzer. Like another reviewer said, name it “Fort Worth”...or Austin...or Nacogdoches...because it’s not Dallas!",58,2,

Want a lighter shade, make another blush. Call is Ft. Worth. I don’t care... Just give me back my old, darker Dallas. This new shade does NOTHING for me.",88,2,
blush,BENEFIT COSMETICS,Benefit Cosmetics Dallas Blush Mini,verybecca,Rouge,Rookie,"['Hair Condition Coarse', 'Eye Color Brown', 'Hair color Brunette', 'Skin Tone Olive', 'Skin Type Oily']",4 stars,8 Mar 2020,no,,,,This a lovely light rosy matte bronzer. It basically has nothing to do with the original Dallas which was a reddish bronze that delivered a “sunburnt” effect. This is just a bronzer blush. No shimmer detected in mine but I do like the color. Very small size!,14,1,Recommends this product
